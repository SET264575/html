          If you call a consulting service to see a patient in the hospital (for example, calling ortho when you admit a patient to the hospitalist), 
          please Enter a Consult Order in Meditech. The consultant gets that patient added to their list. If you don't do this, the consult may fall 
          through the cracks.

         Intra-facility Transfers

        <div class = "policytext">
        When we send patients out of the ED to a different Department without admitting them, there is a specific process.

Please see below.

This applies when you send someone elsewhere and then they will be discharged or the final disposition will be determined by another provider:
- OR 
- GI Lab
- Interventional Radiology
- Labor and Deliver


 
We are still having some difficulty with performing the correct steps in order for the surgeons document in the patient’s chart. 
Below is the correct process for the providers from what I have gathered, please confirm that this is the provider’s process as you know it.
 
Click Discharge
Click on Transfer Intra-facility
Enter the accepting Surgeon
Click Begin transfer is they are not going to be admitted following the surgery. Click Ready to Admit if the will be admitted following Surgery.
Enter a Consult to the accepting Surgeon

          Some providers have ordered phenergan IV. That option isn't available in Meditech for a reason. The complications from extravasation are substantial,
          and it is hospital policy that it NOT be given IV. Please do not insist. Give it IM or try something else equally as effective (Metoclopramide,
          Prochlorperazine, Haloperidol, Droperidol).

          The radiology techs have been instructed to be strict about their contrast allergy protocol. Please don't insist that they change their process 
          If you want a patient to get different medications for contrast allergy, or you don't want to wait the one hour required by their protocol, discuss with 
          the radiologist on call. Leave the tech alone.
