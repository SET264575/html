          If you call a consulting service to see a patient in the hospital (for example, calling ortho when you admit a patient to the hospitalist), 
          please Enter a Consult Order in Meditech. The consultant gets that patient added to their list. If you don't do this, the consult may fall 
          through the cracks.

          Some providers have ordered phenergan IV. That option isn't available in Meditech for a reason. The complications from extravasation are substantial,
          and it is hospital policy that it NOT be given IV. Please do not insist. Give it IM or try something else equally as effective (Metoclopramide,
          Prochlorperazine, Haloperidol, Droperidol).

          the radiologist on call. Leave the tech alone.
