    <h4>Syphilis screening</h4>
    <p>
    The order for a "Syphilis screen" does a screening test and the reflexes to confirmatory tests.  The screening test is resulted as "Treponema pallidum Ab" which is
    confusing becauses this seems to be a Treponema-specific test that would not require confirmation.  However, additional tests are needed to confirm that this truly
    represents active syphilis infection. These confirmatory tests, which take about 5 days to result,  include "T.pallidum Ab (TP-PA), as well as "RPR" and "RPR Titer/FTA".
    A negative RPR suggests that the antibody test may represent a previously-treated case of syphilis.  The Boone Hospital lab states that they will report the patient to the
    health department only after the confirmatory tests are available and positive.<br><br>
