      <p>Antibiotic therapy: neonates to age 1 month
In the first month of life, the most common microorganisms are group B or D streptococci, 
Enterobacteriaceae (eg, E coli), and L monocytogenes. Primary treatment consists of a 
combination of ampicillin and cefotaxime. The recommended dosage for cefotaxime is 50 mg/kg IV every 6 hours,
 up to 12 g/day. Ampicillin dosages are as follows:

Age 0-7 days – 50 mg/kg IV every 8 hours

Age 8-30 days – 50-100 mg/kg IV every 6 hours

Alternative treatment consists of ampicillin plus gentamicin. Gentamicin dosages are as follows:

Age 0-7 days – 2.5 mg/kg IV or intramuscularly (IM) every 12 hours

Age 8-30 days – 2.5 mg/kg IV or IM every 8 hours

Most authorities recommend adding acyclovir 10 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for herpes simplex encephalitis.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>In infants 1 to 3 months of age, the first-line agent is cefotaxime (50 mg/kg IV every 6 hours, up to 12 g/day)
 or ceftriaxone (75 mg/kg initially, then 50 mg/kg every 12 hours, up to 4 g/day) plus 
ampicillin (50-100 mg/kg IV every 6 hours). An alternative agent is chloramphenicol (25 mg/kg orally or IV every 12 hours)
 plus gentamicin (2.5 mg/kg IV or IM every 8 hours).

If the local prevalence of drug-resistant S pneumoniae (DRSP) is higher than 2%, vancomycin (15 mg/kg IV every 8 hours)
 should be added. Treatment with dexamethasone (0.4 mg/kg IV every 12 hours for 2 days or 0.15 mg/kg IV every 6 hours for 4 days)
 should be strongly considered, starting 15 to 20 minutes before the first dose of antibiotics.</p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Age 3 months - 7 years</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>In older infants or young children (age 3 months to 7 years), the most common 
microorganisms are S pneumoniae, N meningitidis, and H influenzae. Primary treatment is 
with either cefotaxime (50 mg/kg IV every 6 hours, up to 12 g/day) or ceftriaxone (75 mg/kg initially,
 then 50 mg/kg every 12 hours, up to 4 g/day).

If the prevalence of DRSP is greater than 2%, vancomycin (15 mg/kg IV every 8 hours) should be added.
 In countries with a low prevalence of DRSP, penicillin G (250,000 units/kg/day IM or IV in
 3-4 divided doses) may be considered. Because of the increasing prevalence of DRSP, penicillin G is no longer recommended in the United States.

An alternative (which may also be chosen if the patient is severely allergic to penicillin) is chloramphenicol (25 mg/kg orally or IV every 12 hours) plus vancomycin (15 mg/kg IV every 8 hours). Treatment with dexamethasone (0.4 mg/kg IV every 12 hours for 2 days or 0.15 mg/kg IV every 6 hours for 4 days) should be strongly considered, starting 15 to 20 minutes before the first dose of antibiotics.

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Age 7 - 50 years</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>In an older child or an otherwise healthy adult (age 7-50 years), the most common microorganisms in bacterial meningitis are S pneumoniae, N meningitidis, and L monocytogenes. In areas where the prevalence of DRSP is greater than 2%, primary treatment consists of with either cefotaxime or ceftriaxone plus vancomycin. Pediatric dosing is as follows:

Cefotaxime – 50 mg/kg IV every 6 hours, up to 12 g/day

Ceftriaxone – 75 mg/kg initially, then 50 mg/kg every 12 hours, up to 4 g/day

Vancomycin – 15 mg/kg IV every 8 hours

Adult dosing is as follows:

Cefotaxime – 2 g IV every 4 hours

Ceftriaxone – 2 g IV every 12 hours

Vancomycin – 750-1000 mg IV every 12 hours or 10-15 mg/kg IV every 12 hours

Some experts add rifampin (pediatric dose, 20 mg/kg/day IV; adult dose, 600 mg/day orally). If Listeria is suspected, ampicillin (50 mg/kg IV every 6 hours) is added.

An alternative (which may also be chosen if the patient is severely penicillin-allergic) is chloramphenicol (12.5 mg/kg IV every 6 hours; not bactericidal) or clindamycin (pediatric dose, 40 mg/kg/day IV in 3-4 doses; adult dose, 900 mg IV every 8 hours; active in vitro but no clinical data) or meropenem (pediatric dose, 20-40 mg/kg IV every 8 hours; adult dose, 1 g IV every 8 hours; active in vitro but few clinical data). Imipenem is a proconvulsant and must be avoided.

In areas with a low prevalence of DRSP, cefotaxime or ceftriaxone plus ampicillin is recommended. Pediatric dosing is as follows:

Cefotaxime – 50 mg/kg IV every 6 hours, up to 12 g/day

Ceftriaxone – 75 mg/kg initially, then 50 mg/kg every 12 hours, up to 4 g/day

Ampicillin – 50 mg/kg IV every 6 hours

Adult dosing is as follows:

Cefotaxime – 2 g IV every 4 hours

Ceftriaxone – 2 g IV every 12 hours

Ampicillin – 50 mg/kg IV every 6 hours

An alternative (which may also be chosen if the patient is severely penicillin-allergic) is chloramphenicol (12.5 mg/kg IV every 6 hours) plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX; TMP 5 mg/kg IV every 6 hours) or meropenem (pediatric dose, 20-40 mg/kg IV every 8 hours; adult dose, 1 g IV every 8 hours).

Data on the need for dexamethasone treatment in adults are limited, though there is support for its use in developed countries when S pneumoniae is the suspected organism. The first dose of dexamethasone (0.4 mg/kg every 12 hours IV for 2 days or 0.15 mg/kg every 6 hours for 4 days) should be administered 15 to 20 minutes before the first dose of antibiotics.

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Age Older than 50 years</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>In adults older than 50 years or adults with disabling disease or alcoholism, the most common microorganisms are S pneumoniae, coliforms, H influenzae, Listeria species, P aeruginosa, and N meningitidis.

Primary treatment, if the prevalence of DRSP is greater than 2%, is with either cefotaxime (2 g IV every 4 hours) or ceftriaxone (2 g IV every 12 hours) plus vancomycin (750-1000 mg IV every 12 hours or 10-15 mg/kg IV every 12 hours). If the CSF gram stain shows gram-negative bacilli, ceftazidime (2 g IV every 8 hours) is given. In areas of low DRSP prevalence, treatment consists of cefotaxime (2 g IV every 4 hours) or ceftriaxone (2 g IV every 12 hours) plus ampicillin (50 mg/kg IV every 6 hours). Other options are meropenem, TMP-SMX, and doxycycline.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend adjunctive dexamethasone in patients with suspected or proven community-acquired bacterial meningitis, but only in high-income countries. [44] The first dose of dexamethasone (0.4 mg/kg IV every 12 hours for 2 days or 0.15 mg/kg every 6 hours for 4 days) is given 15 to 20 minutes before the first dose of antibiotics.
