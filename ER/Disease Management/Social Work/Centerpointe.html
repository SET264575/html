Boone Health Primary Care takes ALL INSURANCE. 

Any patient without a primary doc should get a referral using the referral/order sheet. They will even see uninsured patients at a discount.
In general, patients that are self-pay/uninsured should be referred to a community clinic by our social workers. Let them know or fill out the Social Work referral form (the secretary can give one to you). Compass and Clarity are community clinics with federal subsidies that will see people with no insurance, their cost is on a sliding scale based on income.
United Way: 211. Just like 911, this is a phone number to call for local resources (food, housing, other assistance)
