          In asymptomatic patients, treatment is not necessary. Observation and long-term follow-up may be considered; however, most patients do not require imaging follow-up in lesions less than 5 cm unless rapid growth or diagnosis is uncertain. As mentioned before, a percutaneous biopsy is not indicated, given the risk of hemorrhage.[8][9][10]

In symptomatic patients or those with hemangiomas large enough, causing mass effect, surgical resection should be considered after other causes of pain have been excluded. Surgical resection options are liver resection, hepatic artery ligation, enucleation, and in severe cases, liver transplantation. Surgery is not entirely curative for symptoms, as it has been reported that 25% of those undergoing resection had persistence of symptoms.

Non-surgical Treatment Options

    Hepatic artery embolization: manage acute bleeding, symptoms, and decrease size before surgical resection
    Radiotherapy: rarely utilized and reserved for those lesions associated with Kasabach-Merritt Syndrome. It may aid in the decrease of the tumor size but has increased secondary risks of malignancy.
    Interferon alfa-2a: May work as an anti-angiogenic agent, but success has not been proven.
          
Differential Diagnosis

Cholangiocarcinomas demonstrate delayed persistent enhancement on CT and MRI; however, they tend to be heterogeneous on CT/MRI and less hyperintense on T2 weighted images. Additionally, they often invade and/or obstruct vasculature and bile ducts.

Hypervascular metastases should be considered in the setting of extra-hepatic malignancy. These tend to be multiple at the time of presentation and show contrast washout on delayed phase images. 

Hepatic angiosarcomas also tend to be multiple at the time of presentation, demonstrate vascular invasion and are more aggressive. These also tend to show contrast washout on delayed phase imaging. Lesions may also be present within the spleen.
