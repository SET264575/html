          The 2013 American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines for management of pulmonary nodules state that nodules 4 mm or smaller in a low-risk patient do not warrant further imaging.11 All other scenarios involve repeat CT over six to 24 months, except in high-risk patients, who should be reevaluated in three months. The ACCP recommends the use of low-dose, non–contrast-enhanced CT to minimize radiation exposure. Ground-glass or subsolid nodules are suspicious for early adenocarcinoma.11 For these, the cutoff for further surveillance is at least 6 mm and involves repeat CT (with thin sections) annually for at least three years. The ACCP has a low threshold for recommending PET scans and biopsy; PET scans are recommended for nodules 8 mm or larger in low- to moderate-risk patients with pretest probability of malignancy of 5% to 65%.11 The ACCP endorses the risk calculator available at http://www.nucmed.com/nucmed/SPN_Risk_Calculator.aspx.

          In asymptomatic patients, treatment is not necessary. Observation and long-term follow-up may be considered; however, most patients do not require
          imaging follow-up in lesions less than 5 cm unless rapid growth or diagnosis is uncertain. As mentioned before, a percutaneous biopsy is not 
          indicated, given the risk of hemorrhage.

In symptomatic patients or those with hemangiomas large enough, causing mass effect, surgical resection should be considered after other causes of pain have
          been excluded. Surgical resection options are liver resection, hepatic artery ligation, enucleation, and in severe cases, liver transplantation. 
          Surgery is not entirely curative for symptoms, as it has been reported that 25% of those undergoing resection had persistence of symptoms.

Non-surgical Treatment Options

    Hepatic artery embolization: manage acute bleeding, symptoms, and decrease size before surgical resection
    Radiotherapy: rarely utilized and reserved for those lesions associated with Kasabach-Merritt Syndrome. It may aid in the decrease of the tumor size 
          but has increased secondary risks of malignancy.
    Interferon alfa-2a: May work as an anti-angiogenic agent, but success has not been proven.
          
Differential Diagnosis

Cholangiocarcinomas demonstrate delayed persistent enhancement on CT and MRI; however, they tend to be heterogeneous on CT/MRI and less hyperintense on T2 
          weighted images. Additionally, they often invade and/or obstruct vasculature and bile ducts.

Hypervascular metastases should be considered in the setting of extra-hepatic malignancy. These tend to be multiple at the time of presentation and show 
          contrast washout on delayed phase images. 

Hepatic angiosarcomas also tend to be multiple at the time of presentation, demonstrate vascular invasion and are more aggressive. These also tend to 
          show contrast washout on delayed phase imaging. Lesions may also be present within the spleen.

The ACR recommends no further workup in low-risk patients who have lesions smaller than 5 mm, or larger lesions with low attenuation (20 Hounsfield units [HU] or less) or benign imaging features.1 Lesions of any size with “flash-filling” (robust enhancement) are usually benign hemangiomas. Suspicious findings include solid lesions 5 mm or larger, or those with ill-defined margins, enhancement greater than 20 HU, a heterogenous appearance, or interval growth.1,13

Simple liver cysts may not require further evaluation or monitoring. Indeterminate primarily cystic lesions may need to be followed by ultrasonography until they have been confirmed benign. Benign cystadenomas are rare and seldom undergo malignant transformation; however, further workup may be warranted because imaging cannot reliably distinguish between benign and malignant cystadenomas.14 Cavernous hemangiomas, which show peripheral nodular enhancement on CT, account for most benign liver incidentalomas. Risk of rupture is exceedingly low in those smaller than 11 cm, and they are not treated in asymptomatic patients.13

Hepatic adenomas are found in women of reproductive age and are often associated with oral contraceptive use.13 Oral contraceptives should be discontinued, and serial imaging should be performed. Pregnancy exacerbates lesions; therefore, nonhormonal contraception should be used. Larger or persistent lesions carry some risk of malignant transformation and bleeding, and surgical resection should be considered. Focal nodular hyperplasia describes benign tumors that also occur in young women. Unlike hemangiomas, their arterial feed is centrally located and may be described as a central scar on imaging.

Standard abdominal CT is a single-phase study that is unable to adequately characterize hepatic lesions. Multiphasic CT or MRI is preferred.1,13 Percutaneous biopsy is sometimes required and carries a low complication rate of 2.0% to 4.8%.1 Surgical resection is warranted in patients for whom hepatocellular carcinoma cannot be excluded.
