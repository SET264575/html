          The 2013 American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines for management of pulmonary nodules state that nodules 4 mm or smaller in a low-risk patient
          do not warrant further imaging.11 All other scenarios involve repeat CT over six to 24 months, except in high-risk patients, who should be reevaluated in 
          three months. The ACCP recommends the use of low-dose, non–contrast-enhanced CT to minimize radiation exposure. Ground-glass or subsolid nodules are 
          suspicious for early adenocarcinoma.11 For these, the cutoff for further surveillance is at least 6 mm and involves repeat CT (with thin sections) annually 
          for at least three years. The ACCP has a low threshold for recommending PET scans and biopsy; PET scans are recommended for nodules 8 mm or larger in low- to 
          moderate-risk patients with pretest probability of malignancy of 5% to 65%.11 The ACCP endorses the risk calculator available

Adrenal lesions are detected on 3% to 4% of CT and MRI studies. One study showed that 1.2% of lesions are malignant, and all exceeded 5 cm. Metastatic 
          lesions are rare in patients without a history of cancer and, when present, are associated with bronchogenic carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, 
          and melanoma.

Lesions smaller than 1 cm with fatty or cyst-like consistency do not require further workup. Lesions larger than 4 cm should be further evaluated with 
          special imaging modalities and are usually biopsied unless they are convincingly benign, such as cysts or myelolipomas. Lesions 1 to 4 cm in 
          size are often benign adenomas.

A benign lesion can be confirmed in one of three ways: stability over six to 12 months, low attenuation (10 HU or less on unenhanced CT), or confirmation 
          of lipid-rich adenoma through chemical-shift MRI. A subset of benign lesions may be lipid-poor or have HU greater than 10. For these indeterminate
          lesions, an adrenal CT protocol includes CT washout tests. Malignant lesions have a low washout.

In patients with no history or physical findings to suggest hyperfunctioning lesions, physicians may defer a hormonal workup, although endocrinologists 
          from the Mayo Clinic recommend annual monitoring. Such monitoring includes 24-hour urine cortisol and metanephrine/catecholamine levels, and 
          plasma aldosterone and renin testing.

In 2012, the ACR updated their appropriateness criteria for management of adrenal incidentalomas.

Numerous studies have attempted to define characteristics which increase the likelihood that a given gallbladder polyp may be malignant. Some studies have revealed that age, presence of diabetes mellitus,[34] size of polyp, gallstones, solitary polyp, and symptomatic polyp are important factors for malignancy.

Many studies have demonstrated that malignant gallbladder polyps are significantly more common in patients aged over 50. Polyp size has long been noted to be an important factor. Gallbladder polyps larger than 1.5 cm, especially in solitary sessile hypoechogenic polyps, are associated with a risk of malignancy.

Generally, polyps that are smaller than 1 cm and are asymptomatic are monitored for 6–12 months with control ultrasound scans, in order to detect any rapid growth. However, some studies have demonstrated that the polyp's diameter alone is not a safe exclusion criteria for neoplasm,[2,32] and therefore, recommend strongly consideration for cholecystectomy for any polyp greater than 6 mm.
          
          Primary sclerosing cholangitis
Primary sclerosing cholangitis is one of the risk factors for malignancy in a gallbladder polyp. Any gallbladder polyp, regardless of size, in a patient with primary sclerosing cholangitis should be considered for cholecystectomy. Solitary sessile polyps greater than 10 mm in patients over age 50 should be considered for cholecystectomy, particularly in patients with cholelithiasis and primary sclerosing cholangitis.[7–9,39] Although gallbladder polyps are common and are usually benign in the general population, they are often malignant in primary sclerosing cholangitis. Therefore, regardless of size, any gallbladder polyps in a patient with primary sclerosing cholangitis should be considered for cholecystectomy.[40] If a cholecystectomy is not performed, careful follow-up is warranted.
          
          
          Clinical series, indications for surgery, and recommended follow-up
Any gallbladder polyp that is felt to be symptomatic should be removed. In patients at risk for malignancy, a polyp of 6 mm or greater should likely be resected. Patients without risk factors are good candidates for EUS for further evaluation. Those polyps that are considered high risk by EUS criteria should be considered for resection.

The cholecystectomy should only be undertaken in cases where there are clinical signs of gallbladder polyps, polyps with diameters greater than 10 mm, fast-growing polyps, sessile polyps or wide-based polyps, polyps with long pedicles, patient aged over 50, concurrent gallstones, polyps of the gallbladder in fundibulum or abnormal gallbladder wall ultrasound.[1] The surgery of choice is laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A gallbladder polyp greater than 18 mm in size has a high likelihood of being an advanced cancer; it should be removed with open cholecystectomy, partial liver resection, and possible lymph node dissection.[8]

Gallbladder polyps that are not resected should be followed-up with serial ultrasound examinations. Clear guidelines on a screening interval are so far not available, even though a screening interval of every 6–12 months has been documented.[8] It would be more efficient to make a flexible and tailored follow-up plan or treatment plan for gallbladder polyps based on scientifically found signs rather than fixed or inflexible guidelines.[10]

The reviewers’ comments
In the majority of patients, diagnosis of gallbladder polyps is an incidental finding or following cholecystectomy for acute or chronic cholecystitis. Even though most of the gallbladder polyps are benign in nature, malignant polyps are found in some cases. Because advanced gallbladder cancer displays poor prognosis, early detection and appropriate early measure are important for curative treatment and long-term survival. The primary goal in the management of gallbladder polyps is to prevent the development of gallbladder carcinoma, even though it is a rare illness. Therefore, better understanding of clinicopathologic characteristics and further investigations into risk factors for gallbladder polyps are necessary for establishment of appropriate treatment strategies.

Clinical recommendations
If there are signs of malignancy, the patient should have a cholecystectomy in a hospital where a prompt liver resection could be performed. In doubtful cases, a laparoscopic approached may be tried, and a cholecystectomy performed if there are no signs of growth to the serosa at laparoscopy. If there are signs of growth in the serosa, an open approach must be recommended and – if a frozen section shows malignancy – a resection of the nearby liver segments and the tissue in the duodeno-hepatic ligament may be tried. Also if frozen section shows malignancy after laparoscopic cholecystectomy, an enlarged resection must be considered during the same surgical procedure.

In patients with age ≥60 years, sessile polyp morphology, and polyp size ≥10 mm, a generous approach to EUS or multislice CT (in the future maybe virtual gallbladder scopy?) for closer characterization should be the normal. In all cases where there are indications of malignancy, a cholecystectomy should be recommended.

If there are no signs of malignancy, a follow-up with the same modality is done after 6 months. If by 6 months there is no changes in size, contour, or vascualrity, the follow-up should be individualized – most often a follow-up after another 12 months could be recommended.

For polyps 6–9 mm in diameter without signs of malignancy, a new US is recommended after 6 months. If the does not show any significant changes a new US is recommended after another 12 months and if no changes is found than no further imaging studies are made. Gallbladder polyps smaller than 6 mm are not followed up, if there are no indications of malignancy.

          In asymptomatic patients, treatment is not necessary. Observation and long-term follow-up may be considered; however, most patients do not require
          imaging follow-up in lesions less than 5 cm unless rapid growth or diagnosis is uncertain. As mentioned before, a percutaneous biopsy is not 
          indicated, given the risk of hemorrhage.

In symptomatic patients or those with hemangiomas large enough, causing mass effect, surgical resection should be considered after other causes of pain have
          been excluded. Surgical resection options are liver resection, hepatic artery ligation, enucleation, and in severe cases, liver transplantation. 
          Surgery is not entirely curative for symptoms, as it has been reported that 25% of those undergoing resection had persistence of symptoms.

Non-surgical Treatment Options

    Hepatic artery embolization: manage acute bleeding, symptoms, and decrease size before surgical resection
    Radiotherapy: rarely utilized and reserved for those lesions associated with Kasabach-Merritt Syndrome. It may aid in the decrease of the tumor size 
          but has increased secondary risks of malignancy.
    Interferon alfa-2a: May work as an anti-angiogenic agent, but success has not been proven.
          
Differential Diagnosis

Cholangiocarcinomas demonstrate delayed persistent enhancement on CT and MRI; however, they tend to be heterogeneous on CT/MRI and less hyperintense on T2 
          weighted images. Additionally, they often invade and/or obstruct vasculature and bile ducts.

Hypervascular metastases should be considered in the setting of extra-hepatic malignancy. These tend to be multiple at the time of presentation and show 
          contrast washout on delayed phase images. 

Hepatic angiosarcomas also tend to be multiple at the time of presentation, demonstrate vascular invasion and are more aggressive. These also tend to 
          show contrast washout on delayed phase imaging. Lesions may also be present within the spleen.

The ACR recommends no further workup in low-risk patients who have lesions smaller than 5 mm, or larger lesions with low attenuation (20 Hounsfield units [HU] or less) or benign imaging features.1 Lesions of any size with “flash-filling” (robust enhancement) are usually benign hemangiomas. Suspicious findings include solid lesions 5 mm or larger, or those with ill-defined margins, enhancement greater than 20 HU, a heterogenous appearance, or interval growth.1,13

Simple liver cysts may not require further evaluation or monitoring. Indeterminate primarily cystic lesions may need to be followed by ultrasonography until they have been confirmed benign. Benign cystadenomas are rare and seldom undergo malignant transformation; however, further workup may be warranted because imaging cannot reliably distinguish between benign and malignant cystadenomas.14 Cavernous hemangiomas, which show peripheral nodular enhancement on CT, account for most benign liver incidentalomas. Risk of rupture is exceedingly low in those smaller than 11 cm, and they are not treated in asymptomatic patients.13

Hepatic adenomas are found in women of reproductive age and are often associated with oral contraceptive use.13 Oral contraceptives should be discontinued, and serial imaging should be performed. Pregnancy exacerbates lesions; therefore, nonhormonal contraception should be used. Larger or persistent lesions carry some risk of malignant transformation and bleeding, and surgical resection should be considered. Focal nodular hyperplasia describes benign tumors that also occur in young women. Unlike hemangiomas, their arterial feed is centrally located and may be described as a central scar on imaging.

Standard abdominal CT is a single-phase study that is unable to adequately characterize hepatic lesions. Multiphasic CT or MRI is preferred.1,13 Percutaneous biopsy is sometimes required and carries a low complication rate of 2.0% to 4.8%.1 Surgical resection is warranted in patients for whom hepatocellular carcinoma cannot be excluded.

Cystic lesions without malignant potential include pseudocysts and non-neoplastic pancreatic cysts. Pseu-docysts are common, lack epithelial lining, and often occur after pancreatitis. Non-neoplastic pancreatic cysts (e.g., true cysts, retention cysts, mucinous non-neoplastic cysts, lymphoepithelial cysts) are rare.

The ACR recommends MRI to further characterize pancreatic cysts.1 Surgery is recommended for cysts larger than 3 cm with suspicious features (e.g., mural nodules, lymphadenopathy, involvement of bile or pancreatic ducts). Aspiration is recommended for smaller cysts if surgery is being considered; otherwise, radiologic monitoring is suggested for lesions 1 to 3 cm in size. The American College of Gastroenterology recommends endoscopic ultrasonography with aspiration of cysts for biochemical marker analysis to stratify risk.18

The incidence of renal cysts increases with age. They are discovered in up to one-third of older adults25 (Figure 3). Almost all simple renal cysts are benign, and patients can be reassured; however, any complex cyst or mass requires further evaluation.26 With complex cysts, the most important feature to determine malignant potential is enhancement with contrast media. However, enhancement can be equivocal or more noticeable on MRI compared with CT. Consultation with a radiologist is helpful in these cases.

The Bosniak classification is a well-accepted method to triage renal lesions.1,27 Lesions classified as category I (benign simple cyst) or II (benign cystic lesion with some complex features) do not need to be followed. Nonenhancing complex cysts larger than 3 cm (category IIF) have a 5% to 10% risk of malignancy and should be followed with imaging, although the frequency of monitoring is not well defined. Malignancy risk approaches 50% in similar lesions that are more complicated and that do enhance (category III). Category IV lesions include more clearly malignant cystic masses. Suspicious complex renal cysts or masses are usually not biopsied because of the risk of sampling error (exceptions are suspected abscess, lymphoma, or metastatic lesions). Surgical resection is the rule; however, surgery may be avoided in the case of fat-containing solid lesions with the appearance of benign angiomyolipomas.26

According to the 2007 consensus guidelines of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, most ovarian incidentalomas are benign and are often functional 
          cysts in premenopausal women and cystadenomas in postmenopausal women.28 Risk of malignancy is much greater in postmenopausal women with complex cysts and 
          masses. Transvaginal ultrasonography is the preferred imaging modality to further characterize these incidentalomas.

The Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound has published consensus guidelines showing images of low- and high-risk cysts, with recommendations for management. 
          Physiologic cysts 3 cm or smaller in premenopausal women and simple cysts 1 cm or smaller in postmenopausal women are considered normal. For other lesions, 
          frequency of monitoring is not well defined but may range from six to 12 weeks for more concerning lesions, or even yearly for lesions such as dermoids or 
          endometriomas.

The ACR guidelines on adnexal incidentalomas are more stringent.30 Rather than simple cysts, the ACR classifies lesions as benign-appearing cysts (BACs; oval or 
          round, unilocular, and regular/smooth wall, including hemorrhagic cysts) or probably benign cysts (PBCs; similar to benign-appearing cysts but with 
          angulated margins, not round or oval, or not adequately imaged). Immediate ultrasonography should be performed in the following patient groups to further 
          assess ovarian incidentalomas: premenopausal women with PBCs larger than 5 cm; early postmenopausal women with BACs larger than 5 cm or PBCs larger than 
          3 cm; and late postmenopausal women with BACs larger than 3 cm or PBCs larger than 1 cm. Pre-menopausal women with BACs larger than 5 cm or PBCs 3 to 5 cm 
          should have repeat ultrasonography in six to 12 weeks, and early postmenopausal women with BACs 3 to 5 cm should have repeat ultrasonography in six to 12 
          months.

In most cases, fibromas, benign calcifications without associated masses, hydrosalpinx, and peritoneal inclusion cysts need not be followed. Endometriomas and cystic 
          teratomas have very low malignant transformation but should be followed with ultrasonography. Red flag characteristics for adnexal lesions include thickened 
          walls/septa and solid components with blood flow.

Elevated levels of cancer antigen 125 have low sensitivity and specificity in premenopausal women but may indicate malignancy in postmenopausal women with ovarian 
          incidentalomas.
