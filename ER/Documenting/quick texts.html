My name is Doctor Robertson, and I am the Trauma Surgeon for the Columbia Orthopaedic Group. If you \
are receiving this letter, you have been diagnosed with a fracture (broken bone). Please call my nurse, \
Tricia Massey at 573-441-3746 to make an appointment with me during normal business hours (Monday \
through Friday between 7:30 am and 4:30 pm). You will be directed to my nurse, Tricia Massey. She is \
with me in clinic from 8 am - 11:30 am every morning, and may not be able to return your call \
immediately, so please be patient. Most fractures need to be seen within one week from injury, so \
please contact my office as soon as possible to schedule an appointment. Keep in mind that if your \
fracture is stable enough to be sent home from the emergency room, then the need for emergent \
treatment is unlikely. Rest assured that you will be seen in a timely fashion, and well cared for. Keep your \
injured extremity elevated as much as possible to minimize the swelling. Occasionally, you will be asked \
to come to my office on an empty stomach, in case surgery is required. Do not be nervous if that is the \
case. The final decision will not be made until after I see you and spend time explaining your injury and \
all treatment options, giving you the ability to make an informed decision. So hang in there, and my \
fracture team and I will get you through this and on the road to recovery.\n\
Sincerely,\n\
Michael Robertson, MD \n\
Director of Orthopaedic Trauma/Boone Hospital Center";
