  When we send patients out of the ED to a different Department without admitting them, there is a specific process.

Please see below.

This applies when you send someone elsewhere and then they will be discharged or the final disposition will be determined by another provider:
- OR 
- GI Lab
- Interventional Radiology
- Labor and Deliver


 
We are still having some difficulty with performing the correct steps in order for the surgeons document in the patient’s chart. 
Below is the correct process for the providers from what I have gathered, please confirm that this is the provider’s process as you know it.
 
Click Discharge
Click on Transfer Intra-facility
Enter the accepting Surgeon
Click Begin transfer is they are not going to be admitted following the surgery. Click Ready to Admit if the will be admitted following Surgery.
Enter a Consult to the accepting Surgeon
