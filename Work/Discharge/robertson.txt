Hello,
My name is Doctor Robertson, and I am the Trauma Surgeon for the Columbia Orthopaedic Group. If you 
are receiving this letter, you have been diagnosed with a fracture (broken bone). Please call my nurse, 
Tricia Massey at 573-441-3746 to make an appointment with me during normal business hours (Monday 
through Friday between 7:30 am and 4:30 pm). You will be directed to my nurse, Tricia Massey. She is 
with me in clinic from 8 am - 11:30 am every morning, and may not be able to return your call 
immediately, so please be patient. Most fractures need to be seen within one week from injury, so 
please contact my office as soon as possible to schedule an appointment. Keep in mind that if your 
fracture is stable enough to be sent home from the emergency room, then the need for emergent 
treatment is unlikely. Rest assured that you will be seen in a timely fashion, and well cared for. Keep your 
injured extremity elevated as much as possible to minimize the swelling. Occasionally, you will be asked 
to come to my office on an empty stomach, in case surgery is required. Do not be nervous if that is the 
case. The final decision will not be made until after I see you and spend time explaining your injury and 
all treatment options, giving you the ability to make an informed decision. So hang in there, and my 
fracture team and I will get you through this and on the road to recovery.
Sincerely,
Michael Robertson, MD 
Director of Orthopaedic Trauma/Boone Hospital Center
