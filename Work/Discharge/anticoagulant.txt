Warnings about your new blood thinner:
There can be a significant risk of bleeding while taking blood thinners.  It has been determined that, in your case, the benefits of being on blood thinners outweighs the risks of bleeding.

There is a serious risk of bleeding inside your head associated with even minor falls while on blood thinners.  If you fall, even if you do not strike your head, you should return to the emergency department for evaluation, possibly including a CT scan of your head.  

There is also a serious risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.  If you pass blood in your stools, have black stools, or have vomiting that is black or bloody, you should return to the emergency department for evaluation.
