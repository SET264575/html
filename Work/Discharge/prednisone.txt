Regarding your prednisone and stomach ulcers:
Prednisone can cause stomach ulcers.  You should not take other medications that can cause ulcers, such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve), at the same time.  If you are not on any medication to reduce the acid in your stomach, you should take Prilosec 20 mg daily, which you can get over the counter, to help prevent ulcers while you are on prednisone.

Regarding prednisone and your mood:
Prednisone can affect your mood, causing such problems as depression, anxiety, agitation, hallucinations, insomnia, and thoughts of suicide.  If you develop any of these problems, you may need to decrease the dose, or if the symptoms are severe, you may need to stop the prednisone completely.  You should talk to your primary care provider or return to the emergency department for advice on how to cut back on the medication, or whether you need alternate treatment.
