            <h3>Reviewers' Effort</h3><ul>
            <li>1 of 16 reviewers did not complete their charts</li>
            <li>Average was about 0.48 comment on each chart</li>
            <li>Only 1 provider opted to do extra charts in exchange for having more of theirs reviewed.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Results of Review</h3><ul>
            <li>See this section for details of comments made</li>
            <li>Unreviewable charts: 0</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Interesting Cases</h3><ul>
            <li>2 interesting cases were identified</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Trends</h3><ul>
            <li>Participation remains high</li>
            <li>Comments per chart dropped</li>
            <li>Length of comments (a surrogate for quality) is increasing</li>
            <li>However, the majority of the longer comments are from the two of us</li>
            <li>The average length of comments increased due to a drop in the number of comments overall, so ours had more of an effect.</li>
            <li>Only 6 providers completed their charts before the reminder email was sent out on 6/11</li>
            </ul></ul>
            <h3>Anomalies</h3><ul>
            <li>Unreviewable charts: 0</li>
            <li>Providers not completing charts: 1</li>
            <li>I made several mistakes related to introducing the option of additional charts.  This resulted in some providers
            not having as many charts reviewed and some providers receiving reminder emails that only contained 4 charts instead of 5.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>General Teaching Points To Share In Results Email</h3>
            <div style='border: 1px solid blue; margin: 20px; padding: 20px'>
            <h3> General Teaching Points </h3>
<h4> Documenting Discussions With Provider </h4>
With the new coding system, the highest level of billing can easily be obtained for admissions.  As you will recall, the highest level of billing is based on documenting
the highest levels in at least 2 of 3 categories:  Complexity, Data, and Risk.  The decision to admit already gives you the highest level of risk.  Rather than thinking about
whether the complexity will meet the highest level (sometimes it will, but sometimes it won't), it is easiest to document the requirements for the highest level for the Data category.
<br><br>
Although the new coding system may seem confusing, there is one simple trick that will get you the highest level of billing for each admission:<br>
<ul>
<li>Document that you reviewed the labs</li>
<li>Document that you communicated with a provider</li></ul>
The phrasing may be important:<ul>
<li>"Talked to Dr. Petrie" is perfectly acceptable</li>
<li>"Admitted to Dr. Petrie" is likely not acceptable as there is no documentation that a consultation was made (remember this is in the DATA section, so some data needs to be exchanged)</li>
<li>"Talked to the hospitalist" is probably acceptable but in a gray zone.  Also there are other good reasons to mention the provider by name</li></ul>
<h4>Addressing the Chief Complaint and Triage Note</h4>
You should read over the triage note and note any discrepancies between the triage note and the history that you take.<br>
Some examples of addressing the mention of chest pain in a triage note:<ul>
<li>"Despite the triage note, the patient denies any recent chest pain."</li>
<li>"The patient complains mostly of epigastric pain with minimal pain radiating into his chest from his abdomen."</li>
<li>"The patient presents today for vomiting. On review of systems, the patient does report some chest pain 2 weeks ago but has not had any chest pain associated with the vomiting and he is not concerned about the chest pain."</li>
</ul>
Don't avoid addressing the concerns in the triage note just because the nurses got the triage note wrong.<br>
<h4>HEART scores</h4>
As we all know, HEART scores are required for patients diagnosed with chest pain, etc.<br>
But, remember, there are times when a HEART score is not required by TeamHealth but could still be appropriately applied.<br>
For instance, if a patient's final diagnosis is unrelated to chest pain, but the patient mentions chest pain as a significant symptom, they may still
have a high HEART score whether you calculate it or not.  It is easier to address this in the MDM than in court.<br>



                </div>
            <h3>Plans for next month</h3><ul>
            <li>Fix the algorithm so that charts are distributed evenly</li>
            <li>Fix the reminder email to contain 5 emails</li>
            </ul>

            </ul>
            </ul>

 <b>Yes </b><br>Comments: <b>Triage note suggests pt's chief complaint was chest pain, though your HPI discusses mostly dehydration from overdiuresis.

 <b>Yes</b><br>Comments: <b>Although HEART score was not required because the patient was not discharged with an impression of chest pain, it could have been appropriately applied because the patient did have chest pain.

 <b>Yes </b><br>Comments: <b>This was a straightforward case of someone referred by a psychiatrist for a high blood pressure reading, no previous history.  You prescribed lisinopril.  No labs or EKG were performed.  You didn't do anything technically wrong, though it's a little hard to justify a diagnosis of hypertension based on readings from a single day (her SBP was in the 130s by discharge).  Perhaps she was just anxious and didn't need to be on meds but now she is likely to be on this long term. In addition, you have no evidence that her K and renal function are OK before starting lisinopril.  It would also have been OK (and safer) to ask her to do BP checks at home and refer to her PCP for management.  If there were reasons to start meds, it would have been good to have some MDM documented.</b><br><br><br><br><u>Account Number: V00030547314&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visit Date: 4-12-2023&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Reviewed by: Heredia</u><br>6.

</h3><ul><li>Did not mention fever</li><li>If working dx was orchitis - with neg ua and ultrasound suggesting the above - what from
Infectious source remains in diff dx ?</li><li>Ecg not recorded</li></ul><h3>2. Were independent interpretations of imaging and/or EKGs clearly documented?

Were consultations and communication with other providers documented?
</h3><ul><li>Discussed with who, who accepted admission?</li><li>Be explicit about what docs were talked to. "Admitted to McGreevy" doesn't mean that person was talked to in the chart and may lead to under coding. </li><li>Did not mention calling hospitalist, just the plan to admit</li></ul><h3>4. Did anything about the disposition raise concerns?
</h3><ul></ul><h3>5. Was the standard of care met?
</h3><ul><li>Very good MDM section. Explained Dr. Oliver’s thinking and course of action well. </li></ul><h3>6. Does the documentation or lack thereof raise any medicolegal concerns?
</h3><ul><li>This was a patient who presented with persistent nausea.  Your HPI states that her PCP saw her today and sent her to the ER for admission, but evaluation was thorough and unremarkable and you (appropriately) discharged her.  It would have been helpful if possible to mention why the PCP wanted her admitted in the HPI, or to address this in your MDM, in case something happened after discharge and the PCP complained that she should not have been discharged.</li><li>Triage note suggests pt's chief complaint was chest pain, though your HPI discusses mostly dehydration from overdiuresis.  You mention episodes of chest pain, but no details given.  CP was not mentioned in MDM to explain why you don't think it is concerning in this pt with known CAD</li><li>Did you REALLY examine the patients abdomen and back</li><li>Why are you documenting a ROS? It is no longer necessary. </li><li>This was a case about inability to urinate, but PE shows in depth neuro exam with 5/5 strength throughout, finger to nose testing, etc. and other organ systems with in depth PE. No medicolegal concern if the PE was done, but it does seem in depth for a GU complaint. </li><li>no MDM visible </li></ul><h3>7. Were all appropriate sections documented including critical care, procedures, MIPS, HEART score, sepsis, etc?
</h3><ul><li>You may be underestimating your critical care time. (Total time for admitting a critical patient is likely more than 35 minutes by the time you include documentation, review of old records, discussing with admitting providers, re-evaluation, etc.).</li><li>Although HEART score was not required because the patient was not discharged with an impression of chest pain, it could have been appropriately applied because the patient did have chest pain.  HEART score would have been elevated due to age and history of CAD, and should have been addressed in MDM</li><li>n/a</li></ul><h3>8. Should anything else have been considered?
</h3><ul><li>The only description of the wound was “erythema of the mandible.” It might be nice to expound on that some (i.e.: size, induration, fluctuance, etc.).</li><li>This was a straightforward case of someone referred by a psychiatrist for a high blood pressure reading, no previous history.  You prescribed lisinopril.  No labs or EKG were performed.  You didn't do anything technically wrong, though it's a little hard to justify a diagnosis of hypertension based on readings from a single day (her SBP was in the 130s by discharge).  Perhaps she was just anxious and didn't need to be on meds but now she is likely to be on this long term. In addition, you have no evidence that her K and renal function are OK before starting lisinopril.  It would also have been OK (and safer) to ask her to do BP checks at home and refer to her PCP for management.  If there were reasons to start meds, it would have been good to have some MDM documented.</li><li>You spend a lot of time listing out normal labs that really aren't relevant.  This pt was concerned about a DVT.  It would have been sufficient to mention the D dimer was normal.  Also, your physical exam just says "extremities intact without acute injury or deformity".  It doesn't address the patient's concern about her leg swelling, or whether other significant findings (discoloration, tenderness, Homan's) were present.</li><li>Pt presented with shoulder pain.  You specifically mention the pain is improved when the patient places his hand behind his head.  This is very similar to Bakody's sign which suggests cervical radiculopathy.  This should be included in your differential diagnosis</li><li>UTI</li><li>See above. </li><li>No tests were done</li><li>You documented a complete ROS and exam for a dog bite to the thumb.  It seems doubtful that this reflects what you actually did</li><li>In a patient with severe kidney disease who is found to be severely hypokalemic (1.7), it would be wise to recheck (could use bedside electrolytes) to exclude lab error before giving large amounts of potassium replacement.</li></ul><h3>9. Were there any egregious dictation typos?
</h3><ul><li>Minimal typos in HPI</li><li>In the HPI there were several errors, but able to understand what was meant.</li><li>HPI difficult to follow.</li><li>Not quite egregious but unclear of whether foot wound is possible source from clinical exam - "open wound with serious angry was" probably means "open wound with serosanguineous..." or it was really angry looking</li><li>HPI had one borderline incomprehensible sentence regarding fluid intake.</li><li>Patient agrees with revoke hospice and request to be for sensation but not intubate</li></ul><h3>10.
