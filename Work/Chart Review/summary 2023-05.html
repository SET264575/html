            <h3>Reviewers' Effort</h3><ul>
            <li>1 of 17 reviewers did not complete their charts</li>
            <li>Average was about 0.7 comment on each chart</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Results of Review</h3><ul>
            <li>See this section for details of comments made</li>
            <li>Unreviewable charts: 0</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Trends</h3><ul>
            <li>Participation remains high</li>
            <li>Comments per chart remains consistent</li>
            <li>Length of comments (a surrogate for quality) is increasing</li>
            <li>However, the majority of the longer comments are from the two of us</li>
            <li>Charts are done steadily throughout the month</li><ul>
            <li>Specific interventions, including verbal reminders at monthly meeting and reminder emails, have noticeable but small effects</li>
            </ul></ul>
            <h3>Anomalies</h3><ul>
            <li>Unreviewable charts: 0</li>
            <li>Providers not completing charts: 1</li>
            <li>Survey link in email didn't work</li>
            </ul>
            
            </ul>
            <h3>General Teaching Points To Share In Results Email</h3>
            <div style='border: 1px solid blue; margin: 20px; padding: 20px'>
        <h3>Be careful using templates</h3>
        <h4>Problems with Physical Exam Templates</h4>
        There were several examples of physical exam items being documented that almost certainly were not actually performed, such
        as eye exams, thyroid exams, cardiac exams, etc on patients with isolated extremity complaints.  These likely originate from
        using a template that is too detailed for the severity of the complaint.  Since there are new rules for documenting this year,
        you do not have to document a full physical exam or a complete ROS.  Of course, it is helpful to document as thoroughly as
        necessary, but excessive, inaccurate documentation can cast doubt on the remainder of your documentation.  If you want to use
        a template, you can create a second template for focused exams that documents only items that do not require you to touch the
        patient or use an instrument.  On this template, you would want to leave out findings that require:
        <ul>
        <li>use of the stethoscope, otoscope or ophthalmoscope</li>
        <li>palpation</li>
        <li>inspection of parts that are normally covered by clothing</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Problems with ROS Templates</h4>
        Since the rules changed this year, most of us have stopped using ROS templates.  It is faster to dictate the pertinent
        positives and negatives in the HPI, rather than making changes to the ROS template.  There is no longer any need to specify
        that you covered a certain number of systems, so the ROS template provides no benefit.  And there are times when the ROS
        contradicts what is dictated in the HPI because the template wasn't modified after being added to the note.
        </div>
            <h3>Plans for next month</h3><ul>
            <li>Fix the survey link</li>
            <li>Remove Baumstark from next review</li>
            <li>Request more charts from Drew</li>
            <li>Next survey, ask if practice has changed based on results of chart review</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Questions to discuss between the two of us</h3><ul>
            <li>How do we measure the impact (and improve) of an individual comment?</li>
            <ul>One idea for measurement:  In the results email, allow a method to respond to comments so that impactful comments can be noted,
            and shared as an example</ul>
            <ul>One idea for improvement:  encourage longer comments that describe the situation so that the person doesn't have to review the chart to see
            what the comment pertains to.  See Hauan's comment on Beasley's chart.  A better comment would be:  In a young woman with vomiting,
            always check a pregnancy test.</ul>
            <li>Are longer comments preferable (or annoying)?  If so, how do we encourage them?</li>
            <ul>See this <a href = "analysis of comments.html" target = "_blank">analysis of the quality of comments</a><br>
            Ideas:
            <li>Present this analysis</li>
            <li>Use selected comments in a survey.  Have people vote and show results on what the concensus is regarding good comments.</li>
            <li>Have short quiz using selected comments.  Give immediate feedback with short discussion on strengths and weaknesses of the comment.</li>
            </ul><br>
            <ul>Particularly, see my comments on Dudley, Maples, Martinez and Murphey - are these useful or too detailed</ul>
            <li>How do we measure the impact of the chart review?  How do we increase its benefit?</li>
            <ul>
            <li>Ask if chart review process has been useful?</li>
            <li>Monitor whether comments about certain types of problems (e.g. documenting EKGs) decline over time</li>
            <li>More charts reviewed</li>
            <li>Better comments</li>
            <li>Increase number of charts reviewed for providers who care about results</li>
            <li>Drop providers who dilute out useful feedback for others by not giving comments</li>
            </ul>
            <li>How do we decrease the burden of the chart review?</li>
            <ul><li>Reduce the length of the results email by including only questions that have comments, similar to the summary I provide you</li>
            <li>Reduce number of comments that require review of the chart to understand them</li></ul>
            <li>How do we share interesting cases?</li>
            <ul>
            <li>Use them as general teaching points in results email</li>
            <li>Formal presentation at in-person meeting</li>
            <li>?</li>
            </ul>

 <b>Yes </b><br>Comments: <b>Rather than just mentioning every lab or even the abnormal labs, it would be better to interpret the labs.  For instance, you mentioned the very elevated pro BNP, but I do not know what you thought of it.  Is it due to CKD?  Is it consistent with previously levels?
