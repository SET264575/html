            <h3>Burden of Work</h3><ul><li>The average time it took to complete charts was 36 minutes</li> <li>5 people were willing to do more charts</li></ul>
            <h3>Reviewers' Effort</h3><ul>
            <li>3 of 17 reviewers did not complete their charts</li>
            <li>I contacted 8 people on 3/12 to encourage them to complete their review.  All had received the email. Some were unaware of the deadline.</li>
            <li>Average was about 1 comment on each chart</li>
            <li>Physicians generally received more comments than mid-levels did from both physicians and mid-levels</li>
            <li>This suggests mid-levels are not afraid to offer feedback to physicians</li>
            <li>It may indicate that physicians are not as good at documenting as mid-levels</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Results of Review</h3><ul>
            <li>See this section for details of comments made</li>
            <li>Baumstark had two charts that were identified as being concerning</li>
            <li>Ray had one chart that appeared to be missing</li>
            <li>Questions 2, 6, 7, 8 and 9 provided the most useful feedback</li>
            <li>Questions 1, 3, 4 and 5 did not provide much useful feedback with Question 4 standing out as poorly worded</li>
            <li>4 charts could not be reviewed: missing, confidential, were attributd to wrong provider, were attributed to attending who co-signed note but was actually written by the mid-level to whom the chart was assigned to review </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Survey Results</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Only 8 people completed the survey</li>
            <li>There was a suggestion to focus more on medical care and less on billing issues, although when I talked to this provider, they did not have any additional suggestions for changes and said the process was fine.</li>
            <li>Overall the process seemed to be acceptable, with an average rating of 8.2</li>
            <li>There were 3 interesting cases identified.  I have reviewed these charts and none seem actually worth presenting.</li>
            <ul>
            <li>It is unclear why Bard's case was interesting.  I contacted Murphey but her recollection of why she thought it was interesting wasn't consistent with the record.</li>
            <li>Parks' case found incidental renal cell in addition to large ureterolithiasis</li>
            <li>Oliver's case is a straightforward post-arrest resuscitation</li>
            </ul>
            </ul>
            <h3>Anomalies</h3><ul>
            <li>Unreviewable charts</li>
            <li>Providers not completing charts</li>
            <li>Few providers completed survery</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Recommendations</h3><ul>
            <li>Dudley recommended not referring to the process as "peer review" as this often suggests a disciplinary process.  I have begun referring to the process as "chart review"</li>
            <li>Next time, list a specific date (4/15) as the due date, and put it in the subject line</li>
            <li>Question 1 should be re-worded to ask "If any significant labs not addressed?"
            <li>Question 4 should be re-worded to include cases when patient was admitted</li>
            <li>Request 6 charts per provider from Drew so that a chart can be substituted if one is unreviewable</li>
            <li>On next survey, ask if they would want more of their charts reviewed if that meant they had to review more charts</li>
            <li>On next survey, ask if they have suggestions for more useful questions</li>
            <li>At some point in the future, ask in survey if results of previous review affected how charts are done in place of question about how many more charts they'd be willing to review</li>
            <li>Offer a guide on providing good reviews:</li>
            <ul>
            <li>Emphasize the need for comments on why a case is interesting</li>
            <li>Emphasize writing comments focused on educating the reviewee</li>
            <li>Questions that are not applicable do not need a comment</li>
            <li>Contact me to assign a different chart if assigned chart is unreviewable</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Keep an eye on Baumstark's charting which hopefully will improve as these charts were from shortly after she started</li>
            <li>Continue to monitor Questions 1, 3, 4 and 5 and replace if they continue to not provide much useful feedback</li>
            <li>Although none of the charts flagged as interesting seem that worthy of presentation, hopefully if we keep asking, we can identify at least 1 chart per quarter</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Actions Required</h3>
            <h4>Steve</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>Change every reference of "peer review" to "chart review" in emails</li>
            <li>Add due date to assignment email</li>
            <li>Reword questions 1 & 4</li>
            <li>Reword survey</li>
            <li>Provide pointers for good reviews in assignment email</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Orlando</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>Request 6 charts per reviewee from Drew</li>
            <li>I think the providers you want to request charts for are:</li>
