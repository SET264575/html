            <h3>Burden of Work</h3><ul><li>1 person was willing to do more charts</li></ul>
            <h3>Reviewers' Effort</h3><ul>
            <li>1 of 17 reviewers did not complete their charts</li>
            <li>Average was about 0.4 comments on each chart</li>
            <li>8 providers completed charts shortly after they were assigned</li>
            <li>2 more providers completed charts after I sent out a group text</li>
            <li>2 more providers completed charts immediately after I sent out individual texts</li>
            <li>3 more providers completed charts before the deadline</li>
            <li>1 more provider completed his charts after the deadline after giving me a heads up</li>
            
            </ul>
            <h3>Results of Review</h3><ul>
            <li>See this section for details of comments made</li>
            <li>Concerning charts: Monaghan - see comments</li>
            <li>Unreviewable charts: 1 due to it actually being another provider's chart</li>
            <li>Questions 1, 3, 4 and 5 were being monitored from last month.</li>
            <ul>
            <li>Questions 1 and 4 were reworded and yielded significantly better responses.</li>
            <li>Questions 3 and 5 yielded some useful comments.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>EKGs were frequently identified as not being documented.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Survey Results</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Only 5 people completed the survey</li>
            <li>There were 2 interesting cases identified.</li>
            <ul>
            </ul>
            </ul>
            <h3>Anomalies</h3><ul>
            <li>Unreviewable charts: 1</li>
            <li>Providers not completing charts: 1</li>
            <li>Few providers completed survery</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Results of Process Adjustments Made After First Chart Review</h3><ul>
            <li>Dudley recommended not referring to the process as "peer review" as this often suggests a disciplinary process.  I have begun referring to the process as "chart review"</li>
            <ul><li>No discernable effect.</li></ul>
            <li>Next time, list a specific date (4/15) as the due date, and put it in the subject line</li>
            <ul><li>No improvement in the rate of chart completion without additional reminders.</li>
            <li>Perhaps less confusion.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Question 1 should be re-worded to ask "If any significant labs not addressed?"</li>
            <ul><li>Significantly improved responses.</li></ul>
            <li>Question 4 should be re-worded to include cases when patient was admitted</li>
            <ul><li>Significantly improved responses.</li></ul>
            <li>Request 6 charts per provider from Drew so that a chart can be substituted if one is unreviewable</li>
            <ul><li>This was done, and one backup chart was substituted for a bad one. </li></ul>
            <li>On next survey, ask if they would want more of their charts reviewed if that meant they had to review more charts</li>
            <ul><li>This was done, 1 person asked for 2 additional charts (although few responded to the survey at all) </li></ul>
            <li>On next survey, ask if they have suggestions for more useful questions</li>
            <ul><li>This was done, 1 person responded </li></ul>
            <li>At some point in the future, ask in survey if results of previous review affected how charts are done in place of question about how many more charts they'd be willing to review</li>
            <li>Offer a guide on providing good reviews:</li>
            <ul>
            <li>Emphasize the need for comments on why a case is interesting</li>
            <li>Emphasize writing comments focused on educating the reviewee</li>
            <li>Questions that are not applicable do not need a comment</li>
            <li>Contact me to assign a different chart if assigned chart is unreviewable</li>
            <ul><li>This was done, comments seemed a little better and fewer "not applicable" type comments</i></ul></ul>
            <li>Keep an eye on Baumstark's charting which hopefully will improve as these charts were from shortly after she started</li>
            <ul><li>Her charts were better.</li></ul>
            <li>Continue to monitor Questions 1, 3, 4 and 5 and replace if they continue to not provide much useful feedback</li>
            <ul><li>These questions yielded better responses.</li></ul>
            <li>Although none of the charts flagged as interesting seem that worthy of presentation, hopefully if we keep asking, we can identify at least 1 chart per quarter</li>
            <ul><li>Interesting charts were identified this time.</li></ul>
            </ul>
            <h3>Recommendations for Chart Review in May</h3><ul>
            <li>Highlight the survey in the next assignment email.</li>
            <li>Send out a reminder email to those who haven't completed their reviews by about the 12th of the month</li>
            <li>Change "appropriate billing" question to "Was documentation of procedures, critical care, MIPS, HEART score, sepsis lacking?"</li>
            <li>Make a slight change to the text of the comments to encourage reviewers to put comments in the appropriate location</li>
            <li>Documentation of EKGs should be stressed</li>
            <li>There are 2 charts flagged for discussion</li>
            <li>In June, after providers have received the results of 3 chart reviews, ask in survey if results of previous reviews affected how charts are done in place of question about how many more charts they'd be willing to review</li>
