            <h3>General Teaching Points To Share In Results Email</h3>
            <div style='border: 1px solid blue; margin: 20px; padding: 20px'>
            <h2>General Teaching Points</h2>
<h3>Documenting a patient's declining your recommendation</h3>
Patients frequently do not like our advice.  They almost always have the right to not take our advice. A petient who declines admission does not always
have to be signed out AMA.  It is also important that you remember that an AMA form does not necessarily protect you from liability.<br><br>
Consider the case of a patient with an infection.  The patient has an elevated heart
rate, white blood count, and lactate.  It is unclear to you whether the patient will respond adequately with oral medications, especially with his
comorbidities.  You recommend admission but the patient feels better after IV fluids and wants to go home.  You give him IV antibiotics and discharge
him.  You document that the patient was offered admission but chose to be discharged.  This is not an unreasonable course of action.  Some providers 
might choose to have the patient sign out AMA.  Other providers would see this as "shared decision-making".  The important thing is documenting that
the patient made an informed decision.  An AMA form can help document the discussion but it is not necessary.  Although the patient made do fine, it is
also possible that the patient will get significantly worse at home and return significantly worse.  Although you may think that the patient made
an informed decision, the patient may say that he was unaware that he was septic, that he did not realize his comorbidities put him at higher risk, or
how severe the consequences might be if he did get sicker at home.<br><br>
Shared decision-making is a wide spectrum with the AMA form is at one end and a boiler plate statement of "The patient acknowledged the plan and agrees" 
at the other. However, there are varying degrees of documentation in the middle that depend of the risk involved.  You should appreciate the nuances of
when more thorough documentation is required without resorting to an AMA form.<br><br>
<h3>Documenting negative findings</h3>
Patients often arrive with a concern about a specific diagnosis, whether from a Google search or from a provider who referred them to the ER.  Often,
this concern is unfounded.  It is wise to be careful to document specific negative findings in the history and exam which do not support the diagnosis.
Examples include:<br>
<table>
<tr><th>Chief complaint</th><th>Presenting Concern</th><th>Negative findings</th></tr>
<tr><td>Chest pain</td><td>Heart attack</td><td>Very brief pain<br>Lack of associated symptoms<br>Lack of exacerbation with exertion</td></tr>
<tr><td>Leg pain</td><td>DVT</td><td>Lack of leg swelling, calf tenderness, discoloration<br>Negative Homan's</td></tr>
<tr><td>Abdominal pain</td><td>Appendicitis</td><td>Good appetite, No rebound or guarding</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
To only note that the patient has positive signs such as chest wall tenderness, positive straight leg raise, or no BM for 4 days risks confirmation bias.
Surely, you also looked for evidence of the patient's concern, and finding none then reassured them.  You should document these negative findings in
your HPI and physical exam, and then, even better, list in the MDM all of the findings that argue against their concern.

 <b>Yes </b><br>Comments: <b>The patient was initially hypertensive (SBP in 190s).  There was concern for severe sepsis.  Treatment for hypertension was delayed (which seemed appropriate), but eventually given a small dose of metoprolol.  This does not seem unreasonable.  Nevertheless, the patient became hypotensive in the ER and remained hypotensive during surgery for ureteral stent placement, requiring vasopressors, and ICU for 2 days due to hypotension.  In retrospect, the patient's blood pressure was never documented as being hypertensive enough that the metoprolol was required.  If you judge the patient to have severe sepsis or to likely develop severe sepsis, treatment of hypertension can wait.  Also, severe sepsis justifies broadening antibiotic coverage from Rocephin to Vanc and Cefepime which was done in the ICU.</b><br><br><h3>Monaghan</h3><br>4 charts were reviewed by Heredia, Ray, Parks & Hauan<br><br><u>Account Number: V00030681204&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visit Date: 10-1-2023&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Reviewed by: Ray</u><br>3.

 <b>Yes </b><br>Comments: <b>In your MDM, you stated that you recommended the patient return in 48 hours for possible admission if not improved.  The patient was only diagnosed with bronchitis and there is no indication that the patient had anything serious that would warrant concern.

The patient was 99 years old, but this by itself doesn't change her course or need for admission.  If you are concerned about missing a bacterial infection, get a CT chest.
