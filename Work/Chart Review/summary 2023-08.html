            <h3>General Teaching Points To Share In Results Email</h3>
            <div style='border: 1px solid blue; margin: 20px; padding: 20px'>
            <h2>General Teaching Points</h2>
<h3>Differential Diagnoses in the MDM</h3>
There is no requirement to list a differential in the MDM.  Certainly, there are many times when
a differential diagnosis is not required. However, there are at least 4 reasons that a differential
diagnosis is useful.
<h4>It justifies the tests that you ordered</h4>
This is particularly important when the final diagnosis is relatively minor (e.g. constipation),
even though the tests were performed to rule out serious pathology (e.g. SBO).
<h4>It justifies a higher level of billing</h4>
Similarly, the consideration of serious pathology increases the level of complexity and risk involved.
<h4>It may help you in legal situations</h4>
Mentioning the more serious pathology you considered, and especially by explaining why you thought
these were unlikely, may provide some cover in litigation.
<h4>It may help you remember all the things you were worried about</h4>
The differential diagnosis can expand and contract throughout the visit as new information comes in.
In complex cases, if you list your differential diagnosis as part of your initial note, and add to it throughout the visit,
then at the end of the visit, it can help you ensure that you have covered all of your concerns.
<h3>Legal risks of the differential diagnosis and the MDM</h3>
There are a few of ways that a differential diagnosis can make your life harder in a law suit.<br>
<ul>
<li>Don't make it sound like the list is all inclusive.  "The differential diagnosis I considered was MI and PE"
makes it sound like you didn't consider an aortic dissection.  You can never include all of the possibilities in the list.
Just make sure that you leave it open-ended. Use words like "included", "includes, but is not limited to", "etc", "and others", etc.</li>
<li>Don't inadequately justify ruling out conditions.  "CT was normal.  Appendicitis is ruled out." Sometimes a normal CT doesn't actually
show the appendix.  It is ok to discharge someone even if you haven't ruled out all the bad stuff.  In fact, it is safer to concede that you
aren't sure and develop a plan based on your uncertainty, rather than falsely reassuring someone that you've ruled something out that you haven't
or doing additional tests that may not be indicated at the time.</li>
<li>Don't paint yourself into a corner by being too specific.  "Meningitis was ruled out because the WBC was normal, there was no nuchal rigidity and no fever."
You may not think of all the evidence that points against meningitis at the time.  Instead of trying to list everything and forgetting something, you
can say "History, physical exam and lab results do not support meningitis and LP was not warranted." Or, you can list negative findings that any knowledgable
reader would understand without specifically tying it to a specific illness. "WBC normal.  No nuchal rigidity.  No fever."  This gives you more room to
argue in court that you didn't suspect cryptococcal meningitis because the patient was thought to be low risk for HIV because he denied drug use and was married, 
for instance, even though you didn't discuss it in your MDM.
</ul>
<h3>Consider including causes and complications in the differential diagnosis</h3>
The only test you need to diagnosis rapid atrial fib is an EKG and the only test that you need for hypertension is a blood pressure reading.  The tests that we order are 
actually justified by looking for the causes and complications associated with these conditions.
