<h2>Summary of All General Teaching Points</h2>

        <h3>April:  Documenting EKGs</h3>
        <h4>Why is this important</h4>
        In about 10% of our charts, it was noted that an EKG was not documented or that the interpretation was lacking important
        elements. There are at least five reasons why documenting an EKG is important:<ul>
        <li>Unlike images, there is no other documentation of an EKG automatically pulled into the chart.  If you don't mention it,
        there is no indication in the chart that it was done.</li>
        <li>Including the interpretation indicates that it was not only done, but that you looked at it and were aware of the results.</li>
        <li>Occasionally, the discipline of looking at the EKG to document it will help you realize that you had not looked at the EKG and that
        the patient has a significant finding (rapid AF, for example), or that the EKG has not been performed.</li>
        <li>Documenting your independent interpretation of the EKG is one factor in determining the level of billing for the whole visit.</li>
        <li>In some instances, your interpretation of the EKG can be billed separately.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>How to properly document an EKG interpretation</h4>
        In order for the interpretation of the EKG to be billed, 3 of the following 6 elements must be included:
        <ol>
        <li>rhythm and/or rate</li>
        <li>axis (left axis deviation, normal axis, etc)</li>
        <li>intervals (eg, PR, QRS, QTc)</li>
        <li>segment findings (Q-wave, ST elevation, ST depression, T wave abnormalities, etc)</li>
        <li>comparison to priors when applicable (no change from previous, new atrial fib compared to previous, no previous available, etc)</li>
        <li>summary (normal EKG, acute MI, no acute changes, etc)</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Defensible documentation</h3>
        Having other people review charts reveals the difference between what is clear to you when you are looking at the patient, and the story that
        is provided through your documentation.  Questions were raised about whether other diagnoses should have been considered, whether
        imaging was actually looked at, etc.<br><br>
        Here are some specific points that were raised during the review:
        <ul>
        <li>Dictating an interpretation of the EKG or imaging demonstrates that you looked at it</li>
        <li>Even though it is clear to you seeing the patient what is going on, when there are not enough details in the HPI, this leaves
        room for alternative narratives to be developed by lawyers.  If something bad happens later, it needs to be clear that your diagnosis
        and treatment were reasonable at the time.</li>
        <li>Physical exam findings that are inconsistent with the rest of the documentation (most likely because the findings were left over
        from a template that was not altered), help to raise suspicion about other parts of your documentation.  For example, a patient being
        treated for atrial fib with a rate of 155 should not be documented as having a regular rate and rhythm on exam.</li>
        <li>Documenting the specific physician you talked to is important.  It can be helpful to people treating the patient in the hospital
        and to you a couple of years later when you are in a lawsuit.</li>
        </ul>

<h3>May:  Be careful using templates</h3>
        <h4>Problems with Physical Exam Templates</h4>
        There were several examples of physical exam items being documented that almost certainly were not actually performed, such
        as eye exams, thyroid exams, cardiac exams, etc on patients with isolated extremity complaints.  These likely originate from
        using a template that is too detailed for the severity of the complaint.  Since there are new rules for documenting this year,
        you do not have to document a full physical exam or a complete ROS.  Of course, it is helpful to document as thoroughly as
        necessary, but excessive, inaccurate documentation can cast doubt on the remainder of your documentation.  If you want to use
        a template, you can create a second template for focused exams that documents only items that do not require you to touch the
        patient or use an instrument.  On this template, you would want to leave out findings that require:
        <ul>
        <li>use of the stethoscope, otoscope or ophthalmoscope</li>
        <li>palpation</li>
        <li>inspection of parts that are normally covered by clothing</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        <h4>Problems with ROS Templates</h4>
        Since the rules changed this year, most of us have stopped using ROS templates.  It is faster to dictate the pertinent
        positives and negatives in the HPI, rather than making changes to the ROS template.  There is no longer any need to specify
        that you covered a certain number of systems, so the ROS template provides no benefit.  And there are times when the ROS
        contradicts what is dictated in the HPI because the template wasn't modified after being added to the note.

<h3>June:  Documenting Discussions With Provider </h3>
With the new coding system, the highest level of billing can easily be obtained for admissions.  As you will recall, the highest level of billing is based on documenting
the highest levels in at least 2 of 3 categories:  Complexity, Data, and Risk.  The decision to admit already gives you the highest level of risk.  Rather than thinking about
whether the complexity will meet the highest level (sometimes it will, but sometimes it won't), it is easiest to document the requirements for the highest level for the Data category.
<br><br>
Although the new coding system may seem confusing, there is one simple trick that will get you the highest level of billing for each admission:<br>
<ul>
<li>Document that you reviewed the labs</li>
<li>Document that you communicated with a provider</li></ul>
The phrasing may be important:<ul>
<li>"Talked to Dr. Petrie" is perfectly acceptable</li>
<li>"Admitted to Dr. Petrie" is likely not acceptable as there is no documentation that a consultation was made (remember this is in the DATA section, so some data needs to be exchanged)</li>
<li>"Talked to the hospitalist" is probably acceptable but in a gray zone.  Also there are other good reasons to mention the provider by name</li></ul>
<h3>June:  Addressing the Chief Complaint and Triage Note</h3>
You should read over the triage note and note any discrepancies between the triage note and the history that you take.<br>
Some examples of addressing the mention of chest pain in a triage note:<ul>
<li>"Despite the triage note, the patient denies any recent chest pain."</li>
<li>"The patient complains mostly of epigastric pain with minimal pain radiating into his chest from his abdomen."</li>
<li>"The patient presents today for vomiting. On review of systems, the patient does report some chest pain 2 weeks ago but has not had any chest pain associated with the vomiting and he is not concerned about the chest pain."</li>
</ul>
Don't avoid addressing the concerns in the triage note just because the nurses got the triage note wrong.<br>
<h3>June:  HEART scores</h3>
As we all know, HEART scores are required for patients diagnosed with chest pain, etc.<br>
But, remember, there are times when a HEART score is not required by TeamHealth but could still be appropriately applied.<br>
For instance, if a patient's final diagnosis is unrelated to chest pain, but the patient mentions chest pain as a significant symptom, they may still
have a high HEART score whether you calculate it or not.  It is easier to address this in the MDM than in court.<br>

<h3>July:  Managing a patient with SIRS:</h3>
As we all know, a patient meets SIRS criteria when 2 of 4 criteria are met.  However, there are many reasons to have SIRS other than sepsis.  Sepsis is SIRS with an infection.<br>
The sepsis protocol requires antibiotics to be initiated within 3 hours after sepsis is identified.  Nevertheless, there are times when a patient with SIRS should be started on antibiotics even if it is unclear whether they have sepsis.<br><ul>
<li>If a patient has SIRS, but does not have signs or symptoms pointing to a specific infection, and initial testing (chest xray, UA) are negative, it is still reasonable to initiate antibiotics if no better explanation for their SIRS can be found.  </li>
<li>If a patient has evidence of a life-threatening condition (hypotension, hypoxia, etc) and SIRS, it may be reasonable to initiate antibiotics even if the SIRS might be attributable to a non-infectious condition until infection can be completely ruled out (such as with a CT chest).  For example, if a patient has hypotension thought to be due to a GI bleed but the chest xray shows CHF and pneumonia cannot be excluded, antibiotics should be initiated until a chest CT can rule out infection, since the patient could decompensate further while awaiting the CT results.</li>
<li>If the patient with SIRS seems very stable and chest xray and urinalysis are negative and it does not seem reasonable to aggressively search for an infection (say, with a CT), then it is reasonable to order a procalcitonin (and possibly a lactate) to help clarify the situation. </li>
<li>It is always important to address SIRS in your MDM and explain what you think is causing it.</li><ul>
<li>"The patient meets SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and tachycardia. CXR shows pneumonia.  The patient meets sepsis criteria at 1 pm.  There is no evidence of severe sepsis at this time."</li>
<li>"The patient meets SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and tachycardia.  However, there is no evidence of infection.  CXR and UA are negative.  Leukocytosis is likely demargination from vomiting and tachycardia is due to dehydration."</li>
<li>"The patient meets SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and tachycardia.  CXR and UA are negative.  There is no evidence of infection at this time so I have not started antibiotics, however, I have ordered a procalcitonin and lactate to help clarify the situation."</li>
<li>"The patient meets SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and tachycardia.  Source of infection is unclear.  The patient has other possible non-infectious causes to explain their SIRS.  Nevertheless, due to the critical nature of their illness, I have started antibiotics while CT is pending."</li>
</ul></ul>
