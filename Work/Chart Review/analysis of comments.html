<h3>Analysis Of Usefulness Of Comments Without Referring Back To The Chart</h3>
<h4> <span class='green'>Green </span>represents a usable comment</h4>
<h4> <span class='red'>Red </span>represents an unusable comment</h4>
<h4> <span class='blue'>Blue</span> represents a comment that would be useful if it had been expanded upon</h4>
<h3>1. Were there significant abnormal test results that were not addressed?
</h3><ul> 
 <li  class = "green">Why not a second Trop? Too low risk?</li >
<li  class = "green">Rather than just mentioning every lab or even the abnormal labs, it would be better to interpret the labs.  For instance, you mentioned the very elevated pro BNP, but I do not know what you thought of it.  Is it due to CKD?  Is it consistent with previously levels?  Is there other evidence such as CXR to support CHF exacerbation?  This would be more useful than mentioning the AST is 43 and ALT is 29, for instance</li >
<li  class = "green">3+ urine ketones, hyperglycemia, elevated anion gap in type I DM suggests DKA.  VBG and BOHB were not ordered or documented</li >
<li  class = "red">Abnormal's were addressed by Dr Petersen - this was a signout to Gunther; majority of documentation by Brad Peterson</li >
<li  class = "red">Meditech issue:  The labs didn't flow into the chart like they should have</li >
<li  class = "blue">Nstemi</li ></ul>

<h3>2. Were independent interpretations of imaging and/or EKGs clearly documented?
</h3><ul> 
 <li  class = "green">no testing or MDM section</li >
<li  class = "green">CT was done, but there is no documentation of review of the result or films. </li >
<li  class = "green">Consider adding a comment on who interpreted the xray/CT's (i.e.: xrays were normal "per radiology.")</li >
<li  class = "green">No mention of CXR or ECG</li > 
 <li  class = "green">CT findings could have been described better</li >
<li  class = "green">Missing ECG and CXR interpretation!!!</li > 
 <li  class = "green">No independent CXR interpretation</li >
<li  class = "green">No documentation of independent review and interpretation of scans</li > 
 <li  class = "green">Ekg needs time documented</li ></ul><h3>3. Were consultations and communication with other providers documented?
</h3><ul> 
 <li  class = "green">Document discussion with hospitalist </li > 
 <li  class = "green">No documentation of contact with hospitalist prior to admitting. </li > 
 <li  class = "red">Has the patient had a prior stress test?</li > 
 <li  class = "green">No mention of conversation with Hospitalist</li >
<li  class = "green">Discussed the patient case with the inpatient team, may not qualify for coding purposes, may need to be more specific</li > 
 <li  class = "green">No conversation with accepting physician regarding ICU admission is mentioned</li ></ul><h3>4. Did anything about the disposition raise concerns?
</h3><ul> 
 <li  class = "green">Confusing typos in the discharge instructions given to the patient, see #9</li >
<li  class = "green">No discharge instructions about adjusting hydrocortisone dose during acute illness. No documentation in HPI that patient has done this or knows how to do this.</li > 
 <li  class = "blue">LWBS visit. </li > 
 <li  class = "green">Patient was discharged with Na 125, was told to follow up with PCP who is a Boone doc.  No repeat lab in our system. No return to ER or admission however. </li ></ul><h3>5. Was the standard of care met?
</h3><ul> 
 <li  class = "green">Patient should have received 30 cc/kg of fluids for septic shock unless a very good reason, which is not documented.</li > 
 <li  class = "green">There is no documented concern for infection but you prescribed an antibiotic for what seems like a chronic problem.  Also gave Medrol Dose Pak to a diabetic without warning about sugars.  </li > 
 <li  class = "green">Vomiting, hyperglycemia, elevated anion gap seem to be attributed to adrenal crisis rather than DKA.  BOHB, VBG were not checked.  </li ></ul>
<h3>6. Does the documentation or lack thereof raise any medicolegal concerns?
</h3><ul> 
 <li  class = "red">your charting is perfect</li > 
 <li  class = "green">Interesting that you are still doing a ROS</li >
<li  class = "green">Although pt presented with only a finger lac, you document a full physical including listening to heart, etc.  This seems doubtful and something a patient could easily testify against ("The provider never used her stethoscope.") This puts other aspects of the physical exam in question - there could have been other trauma although patient didn't ever complain of anything else.  Did you really examine the head and neck when you documented no evidence of trauma?  Especially given that documentation of a full physical exam is not required for this patient and no longer required for billing, it is best practice to not use a template with an extensive exam for lower level visits.</li > 
 <li  class = "green">You documented a complete physical exam on a patient who presented with chronic foot pain.  These makes much of the exam seem untrustworthy.  Did you really check the patient's light reflex or his thyroid?  You documented a peripheral vision loss - is this real?  If so, you didn't address it.  If not, you need to change your template.    In any case, since documentation of a full physical exam is not required for this patient's complaint and, in general, is no longer required for billing, you should avoid using a complete physical exam template on a low-level complaint.</li > 
 <li  class = "green">Patient could have been critically ill (systolic in 70s on arrival, lactate 3.4, significant lab abnormalities raising concern for DKA).  He may have been clinically fine to go home, but if there were an adverse event after discharge, there is insufficient documentation to justify the discharge</li > 
 <li  class = "green">Patient was being worked up for breast cancer, not noted in the chart.  Not sure if patient did not share or if PMH was not reviewed within Meditech</li > 
 <li  class = "green">90 minutes of critical care documented, this seems excessive. No procedures or drips documented. </li ></ul><h3>7. Were all appropriate sections documented including critical care, procedures, MIPS, HEART score, sepsis, etc?
</h3><ul> 
 <li  class = "green">heart score / critical care time not seen</li > 
 <li  class = "red">not applicable</li > 
 <li  class = "green">Consider a PERC score</li > 
 <li  class = "green">When was sepsis diagnosed? When was time 0?</li > 
 <li  class = "green">NO SEPSIS DOCUMENTATION</li > 
 <li  class = "green">No HEART score but not really needed</li > 
 <li  class = "green">Use of amiodarone drip and Levophed would qualify for critical care.  Also, patient meets criteria for sepsis (leukocytosis, tachycardia, UTI) and probably severe sepsis or septic shock (given hypotension). But lactate not recorded, sepsis is never mentioned, inadequate fluids are given without explanation for why</li > 
 <li  class = "green">Patient may have qualified for critical care - was hypotensive on arrival, received 3 L IVF and IV hydrocortisone. Appropriate diagnosis may have been "adrenal crisis" rather than just "Addison disease" which the patient always has.  </li > 
 <li  class = "green">No MDM narrative.</li > 
 <li  class = "green">Fluid 30ml/kg for severe sepsis
Not documented </li ></ul><h3>8. Should anything else have been considered?
</h3><ul> 
 <li  class = "green">Maybe a UDS if there was concern for hx of substance abuse </li > 
 <li  class = "green">Since patient previously had documented diverticulitis but was only treated with Augmentin (no Flagyl), she could have had smoldering diverticulitis. Since she refused CT, it might have been reasonable to treat the persistent LLQ pain empirically with additional antibiotics (including Flagyl), or at least comment that it was considered and refused.</li > 
 <li  class = "green">Make sure you comment that the patient was already anti coagulated on Eliquis (was he?). And always ask what PRIOR stroke/TIA symptoms or deficits existed and compare to your findings. Doesn't have to be exhaustive. But a simple "is this weakness of the face new or was that there from before?"</li > 
 <li  class = "blue">Pericarditis, Myocarditis</li > 
 <li  class = "blue">You subtly suggested you were giving antibiotics due to concern for an open fracture, but it is subtle and you never expressly mentioned a concern for open fracture.</li > 
 <li  class = "green">There is no "Clinical Impression" documented</li > 
 <li  class = "blue">pregnancy</li > 
 <li  class = "green">elaborating on rule-outs, e.g., obstruction, ischemic bowel, etc.</li > 
 <li  class = "blue">Breast cancer</li > 
 <li  class = "blue">Cxr?</li ></ul><h3>9. Were there any egregious dictation typos?
</h3><ul> 
 <li  class = "green">" Daughter states around yesterday at 2:42 p.m., the patient's out a rust on the phone but fairly normal."

"He has a past surgical history of CABG, cardiac stent placement, left carotid and a cardiac to me.  Has a right carotid and cardiac to me scheduled for 04/18/2023."</li > 
 <li  class = "green">He reports that he was seen at possible ED with injury troponin, which was reported as elevated, prompting them to tell him to come to the ED</li > 
 <li  class = "green">Verbal consent obtained for digital block to write some for laceration repair</li > 
 <li  class = "green">Coronary go on and admit to ICU due to the am and her ODI own drip as well as as hypotension</li > 
 <li  class = "green">Fifty CT scan of your head and cervical spine were unremarkable and "You have a whiplash injury annual have likely symptoms for the next few days" - both in the discharge instructions</li > 
 <li  class = "green">Boot specific pain with pain to his right Achilles with some X doses of the Achilles insertion but able to Dorsey and plantar flex appropriately.</li > 
 <li  class = "green">This is probably a Meditech glitch, but may show up in all of your notes due to the template you are using.  In your physical exam it says "Peripheral pulses: No Peripheral pulses 2+ throughout".  Why is that "No" there?</li > 
 <li  class = "green">Some extra at beginning in regards to smoking hx not connected with story. </li > 
 <li  class = "green">A couple of incomplete sentences.</li > 
 <li  class = "green">In the triage note says patient was seen at immune, which I believe was meant to be  MU  otherwise great report.)</li > 
 <li  class = "green">9 year old instead of 91 year old in exam section</li ></ul>
