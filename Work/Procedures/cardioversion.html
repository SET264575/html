<!--
    Procedure note:  Electrical cardioversion
    Electrical cardioversion was indicated due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, unresponsive to medication.  The risks, benefits and alternatives were
    explained to the patient who provided written consent for the procedure.  The patient had been NPO for 8 hours.  The patient had been consistently taking anticoagulation
    for at least 3 weeks.  The patient was sedated with 10 mg of etomidate.  Once adequate sedation was obtained, a shock of 200 J was administered with resulting cardioversion
    to a normal sinus rhythm.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.
