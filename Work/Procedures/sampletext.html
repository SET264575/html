    Procedure note: Lumbar puncture
    A lumbar puncture was indicated to rule out meningitis.  The risks, benefits and alternatives were explained to the patient who provided written consent for the procedure.
    The patient was placed in a right lateral decubitus position.  The procedure was performed under sterile conditions.  A wide area around the L3-L4 vertebral interspace
    was prepped and draped sterilely using Betadine.  The puncture site was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine.  A 22 gauge needle was inserted into the L3-L4 vertebral interspace
    and 4 cc of clear CSF was obtained and sent for studies.  Opening pressure was 15 cc water.  The needle was withdrawn, the puncture site was covered with a Band-Aid and 
    the patient was placed prone.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.

    Procedure note:  Electrical cardioversion
    Electrical cardioversion was indicated due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, unresponsive to medication.  The risks, benefits and alternatives were
    explained to the patient who provided written consent for the procedure.  The patient had been NPO for 8 hours.  The patient had been consistently taking anticoagulation
    for at least 3 weeks.  The patient was sedated with 10 mg of etomidate.  Once adequate sedation was obtained, a shock of 200 J was administered with resulting cardioversion
    to a normal sinus rhythm.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.

    Procedure note:  Abscess incision and drainage
    The skin over the 3 cm diameter abscess on the left thigh was prepped with Betadine and anesthetized with 4 cc of 1% lidocaine.  An #11 blade was used to make a 2 cm incision
    into the abscess.  The abscess was probed with curved hemostats to break up loculations.  A large amount of pus was expressed from the abscess.  The cavity was packed with 
    1/4" iodoform gauze.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.
