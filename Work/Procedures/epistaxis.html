<!--
A cotton ball saturated with 4% cocaine was placed in the nostril.  After removal of the cotton ball, the nasal mucosa was inspected.  A suspected bleeding site was
identified on the anterior nasal septum and cauterized with silver nitrate.  

A Muricel sponge was inserted into the nostril.

A Rhino rocket was inserted into the nostril.

The patient was observed for 30 minutes with no additional bleeding noted.




Procedure note:  Epistaxis control
Cocaine was applied to her left nares with a cotton ball.  Following adequate anesthesia, a nasal speculum was used to inspect the inside of her nose.  There was persistent actively bleeding but no obvious source on her anterior septum could be found.  A Merocel sponge was trimmed and a new string was secured to the sponge.  The rounded end of the sponge was lubricated with antibiotic ointment and inserted into the left nares.  The patient had good initial control of her bleeding.  She was observed for more than 30 minutes with no recurrence of her bleeding.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.
