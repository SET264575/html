    Procedure note: Lumbar puncture
    A lumbar puncture was indicated to rule out meningitis.  The risks, benefits and alternatives were explained to the patient who provided written consent for the procedure.
    The patient was placed in a right lateral decubitus position.  The procedure was performed under sterile conditions.  A wide area around the L3-L4 vertebral interspace
    was prepped and draped sterilely using Betadine.  The puncture site was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine.  A 22 gauge needle was inserted into the L3-L4 vertebral interspace
    and 4 cc of clear CSF was obtained and sent for studies.  Opening pressure was 15 cc water.  The needle was withdrawn, the puncture site was covered with a Band-Aid and 
    the patient was placed prone.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.
