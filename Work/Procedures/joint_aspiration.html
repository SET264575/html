        Procedure note:  Joint aspiration
    The indications, risks, benefits and alternatives were discussed with the patient and written consent was obtained.  The wide area around right knee was prepped with 
    Betadine and the site was draped with sterile towels.  The puncture site was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine.  An 18 gauge needle was inserted into the joint and 60 cc
    of clear fluid was aspirated.  The joint was then injected with 40 mg of Kenalog and 10 cc of 1% lidocaine.  The needle was withdrawn and the puncture site was dressed 
    with a Band-Aid.  Betadine was cleaned off the surrounding skin.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.
