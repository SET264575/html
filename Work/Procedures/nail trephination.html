<!--
Procedure Note:  Nail trephination
The procedure was indicated for a painful subungal hematoma of the right first fingernail.  A digital block was performed.  The nail and surrounding skin was prepped with 
Betadine.  A high-temperature cauterizer was used to burn 2 holes through the nail.  Blood was expressed through the hole.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  
There were no complications.
