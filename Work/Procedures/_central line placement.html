CONSENT: 
[_] During the informed consent discussion regarding the procedure, or treatment, I explained the following to the patient/designee:

 a. Nature of the procedure or treatment and who will perform the procedure or treatment.

 b. Necessity for procedure and the possible benefits.

 c. Risks and complications (most common and serious).

 d. Alternative treatments and the risks, benefits and side effects of each (including no treatment).

 e. Likelihood of the patient achieving his/her goals without this procedure and surgery treatment.

 f. Problems that might occur during the recuperation.

 g. Conflicts of interest, if any  


[_] The procedure was emergent, the patient was unable to provide consent, and a designee was not immediately available.
 
PROCEDURE SUMMARY: 
The CDC Central Line Insertion Practices form was completed by an  independent observer (_) starting with the first handwash prior to  starting sterile technique. A time out was performed. My hands were  washed immediately prior to the procedure. I wore a surgical cap, mask  with protective eyewear, full gown and sterile gloves throughout the  procedure. The patient was placed in Trendelenburg position. LEFT /  RIGHT chest region was prepped using chlorhexidine scrub and draped in  sterile fashion using a full drape and sterile probe cover and sterile  gel employed. The medial and lateral heads of the sternocleidomastoid  muscle were identified as was the carotid pulse. The Internal Jugular  vein was identified using the ultrasound. Anesthesia was achieved over  the vein using 1% lidocaine. Using real-time out of plane guidance, the  introducer needle was inserted into the Internal Jugular vein under  direct ultrasound visualization. Venous blood was withdrawn. The syringe  was removed and a guidewire was advanced into the introducer needle.  The guidewire was visualized in the Internal Jugular Vein by ultrasound.  A small incision was made at the skin surface with a scalpel and the  introducer needle was exchanged for a dilator over the guidewire. After  appropriate dilation was obtained, the dilator was exchanged over the  wire for a _ central venous catheter. The wire was removed and the  catheter was sutured in place at _ cm. A sterile sorbaview shield was  placed over the catheter at the insertion site. The patient tolerated  the procedure without any hemodynamic compromise. At time of procedure  completion, all ports aspirated and flushed properly. Post-procedure  chest x-ray is pending at this time. Estimated blood loss is _.

EQUIPMENT
Bundle Pack
Triple Lumen Catheter (TLC)
Sterile Gloves
3 sterile line caps
Sterile Ultrasound Cover
Ultrasound Machine
PROCEDURE
Sterilize the patient and apply mask, cap, sterile gown and gloves
Cover the patient and apply sterile probe cover
Flush TLC, leave brown cap uncovered, replace caps with sterile line caps
Prepare guidewire
Visualize the vein with ultrasound
Anesthetize the area with the lidocaine
Visualize the needle entering the vein using ultrasound, once non-pulsatile blood is aspirated remove syringe
Insert guidewire, and NEVER let your hand off the wire from this point on
Once guidewire is inserted remove needle, use scalpel to nick the skin at insertion site
Insert dilator over the wire and hold at the skin and twist in one direction while inserting
Remove dilator and hold pressure with gauze
Insert TLC over the wire, once the wire can be grabbed from the other side, slide catheter over wire
REMOVE WIRE
TLC is placed at 15cm on the right and 18cm on the left
Aspirate blood first and flush all three lines with sterile saline and confirm good return
Place Biopatch blue side up, suture the line in place, 4 sutures needed, place sterile tegaderm
Discard sharps
Chest x-ray for placement and rule out pneumothorax

Attending:

Consent was obtained and a time-out was completed verifying correct patient, procedure, site, and positioning. The patient was placed in appropriate dependent position for central line placement. The patientâ€™s right(?)left groin was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. 1% Lidocaine was(?)was not used to anesthetize the surrounding skin area. Ultrasound was(?)was not used to identify the vein and observe the needle entering the vein. A triple lumen catheter was introduced into the internal jugular vein using Seldinger technique. The catheter was threaded smoothly over the guide wire and guide wire was removed. Appropriate blood return was obtained and each lumen of the catheter was evacuated of air and flushed with sterile saline. The catheter was then sutured in place to the skin and a sterile dressing applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications. Blood loss was minimal.
