PROCEDURE SUMMARY: 
The CDC Central Line Insertion Practices form was completed by an  independent observer (_) starting with the first handwash prior to  starting sterile technique. A time out was performed. My hands were  washed immediately prior to the procedure. I wore a surgical cap, mask  with protective eyewear, full gown and sterile gloves throughout the  procedure. The patient was placed in Trendelenburg position. LEFT /  RIGHT chest region was prepped using chlorhexidine scrub and draped in  sterile fashion using a full drape and sterile probe cover and sterile  gel employed. The medial and lateral heads of the sternocleidomastoid  muscle were identified as was the carotid pulse. The Internal Jugular  vein was identified using the ultrasound. Anesthesia was achieved over  the vein using 1% lidocaine. Using real-time out of plane guidance, the  introducer needle was inserted into the Internal Jugular vein under  direct ultrasound visualization. Venous blood was withdrawn. The syringe  was removed and a guidewire was advanced into the introducer needle.  The guidewire was visualized in the Internal Jugular Vein by ultrasound.  A small incision was made at the skin surface with a scalpel and the  introducer needle was exchanged for a dilator over the guidewire. After  appropriate dilation was obtained, the dilator was exchanged over the  wire for a _ central venous catheter. The wire was removed and the  catheter was sutured in place at _ cm. A sterile sorbaview shield was  placed over the catheter at the insertion site. The patient tolerated  the procedure without any hemodynamic compromise. At time of procedure  completion, all ports aspirated and flushed properly. Post-procedure  chest x-ray is pending at this time. Estimated blood loss is _.
