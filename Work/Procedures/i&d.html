    Procedure note:  Abscess incision and drainage
    The skin over the 3 cm diameter abscess on the left thigh was prepped with Betadine and anesthetized with 4 cc of 1% lidocaine.  An #11 blade was used to make a 2 cm incision
    into the abscess.  The abscess was probed with curved hemostats to break up loculations.  A large amount of pus was expressed from the abscess.  The cavity was packed with 
    1/4" iodoform gauze.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.
