MUD PILERS
Methanol (antifreeze, windshield fluid, fuel, solvents), Ethanol, etc. Methanol is metabolized to formic acid. And formic acid gives off the H+ that is picked up by bicarb, leaving its conjugate base to raise the AG.
Uremia (renal failure)
DKA, alcoholic ketoacidosis
Paraldehyde –
Iron, Isoniazid (INH) – cause lactic acidosis.
Lactic acidosis (Type A, Type B, and D-lactic acidosis). “Lactic acidosis is the most common cause of metabolic in hospitalized patients.”A
Ethylene glycol (antifreeze),. Ethylene glycol is metabolized to glycolic and oxalic acids.
Renal Failure(RF), Rhabdomyolysis. RF leads to accumulation of organic anions such as phosphates, sulfates, urates, etc, which increase the AG.
Salicylates – cause metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis.

MUD PILES
Methanol,
Uremia (renal failure)
Diabetic ketoacidosis,
Paraldehyde,
Iron, isoniazid (INH) – cause lactic acidosis.
Lactic acid,
Ethanol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, or propylene glycol
Salicylates

GOLD MARK
Glycols (propylene glycol and ethylene glycol)
Oxoproline – 5-oxoproline (or pyroglutamic acid) is associated with chronic acetaminophen use, often by malnourished women.
L-lactate,
D-lactate – D-lactic acid can occur in some patients with short bowel syndromes
Methanol,
Aspirin,
Renal failure (vs. uremia)
Ketoacidosis (DKA, alcoholic ketoacidosis)
