<li>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMethanol (antifreeze, windshield fluid, fuel, solvents), Ethanol, etc. Methanol is metabolized to formic acid. And formic acid gives off the H+ that is picked up by bicarb, leaving its conjugate base to raise the AG.</li>
<li>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspUremia (renal failure)</li>
<li>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDKA, alcoholic ketoacidosis</li>
<li>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspParaldehyde</li>
<li>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIron, Isoniazid (INH) cause lactic acidosis.</li>
<li>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLactic acidosis (Type A, Type B, and D-lactic acidosis)</li>
<li>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEthylene glycol  Ethylene glycol is metabolized to glycolic and oxalic acids.</li>
<li>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRenal Failure(RF), Rhabdomyolysis. RF leads to accumulation of organic anions such as phosphates, sulfates, urates, etc, which increase the AG.</li>
<li>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSalicylates cause metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis.</li>

<li>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOxoproline - 5-oxoproline (or pyroglutamic acid) is associated with chronic acetaminophen use, often by malnourished women.</li>
