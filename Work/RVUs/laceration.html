     Lastly, always note these important details: location of the wound, any “extensive cleaning,” removal of particulate matter, debridement of wound edges, undermining of wound edges (“limited” or “extensive”) and simple vs. layered closure.

     The following categories are how Emergency Medicine coders “think” to properly code your encounters:

1) “Simple” laceration repair => involves a single layer closure.

2) “Intermediate” laceration repair => involves extensive cleaning, removal of particulate matter, limited undermining and/or a multiple-layered closure.

3) “Complex” laceration repair => typically involves multiple-layered closure and additional interventions including: A) debridement of devitalized wound edges or B) any “extensive undermining.”

These designations of simple, intermediate or complex in laceration repair indeed matter — distinct RVUs (and associated levels of reimbursement) are assigned for each.

The definition of “limited” vs. “extensive” undermining does warrant special mention. “Extensive” undermining is defined as “a distance greater than or equal to the maximum width of the defect, measured perpendicular to the closure line along at least one entire edge of the defect”. Here’s the translation for Emergency clinicians – i.e. your procedure note should look like this: “The 10 cm thigh laceration was examined and had a maximal width of 1.5 cm. The wound’s edges were under considerable tension and extensive undermining was required. Therefore, using a #11 blade, 1.5 cm of undermining was performed along its entire medial wound edge.”

On the flip side, “limited” undermining involves repairs in which there is undermining from the wound’s edge to a distance less than the maximum width of the laceration itself. (i.e. “0.5 cm of undermining was performed” in the example above) My apologies for getting into the coding weeds! In any event, this would qualify your procedure as an “intermediate” repair.

How to Chart (and Reimburse) Optimally with Laceration Repairs:

“The wound was heavily contaminated by dirt particles and required copious irrigation.” => “intermediate” repair.
“Using forceps, I removed several wood particles from the wound.” => “intermediate” repair.
“Lower Leg 8 cm Laceration Multi-layer Repair…the subcutaneous tissue was closed using 4-0 vicryl, six buried horizontal mattress sutures.  Next the skin was closed using 4-0 nylon, 16 simple interrupted sutures…” => “intermediate” and potentially “complex” repair.
“The wound’s lateral edge was devitalized and irregular. Therefore, this edge required debridement and revision using iris scissors.” => “complex” repair, when associated with multi-layered closure.
