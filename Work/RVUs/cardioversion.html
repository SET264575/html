Answer: Absolutely, yes. There is a specific CPT code, 92960, for such cardioversions. There are no separate codes or modifiers for using paddles or hands-free, and there are no special codes or modifiers for biphasic cardioversion. CPT code 92960 is for elective cardioversion, not defibrillation. There is no separate code for defibrillation. Defibrillation is incorporated into CPR, which has its own CPT code (92950). Therefore, it is important to use the correct terminology in your charting to demonstrate you are cardioverting the patient and not defibrillating the patient.

Previously, the moderate sedation codes were not allowed to be billed along with the cardioversion codes. However, in 2017, this restriction was removed, and they now can be billed together. Lastly, you may bill for multiple clinically necessary 92960 cardioversions on the same patient.
