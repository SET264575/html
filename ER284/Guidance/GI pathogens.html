        <h1>GI pathogen panel</h1>
        <h2>General info</h2>
        <pre>
        <h3>Regarding antibiotic treatment:</h3>
    • Although many identified pathogens will generally cause self-limited disease, it should be assumed that if the patient were ill-enough to present to the ER and to be tested, there is some risk of more severe illness.  Therefore, all patients should be contacted regarding a positive GI pathogen panel.
    • Mild cases of diseases noted to be self-limited do not need to be treated, and many of these patient will be improving by the time they are contacted.  Treatment with antibiotics generally does not shorten the course of the illness or decrease transmission and is not recommended.
    • Treatment is often justified in patients who seem to have more severe cases (very frequent stools, dehydration, etc), more prolonged cases, recurrent gastroenteritis, or higher risk (very young, very old, immunocompromised, significant comorbidities)
    • Patients who are febrile, having severe symptoms, bloody stools, evidence of dehydration should be asked to return for re-evaluation
    • Bloody diarrhea can be associated with pathogens causing HUS.  Antibiotic treatment is thought to increase the risk of HUS.  Since most diarrhea is self-limited anyway, antibiotics should be avoided in patients with bloody diarrhea until the pathogen is identified.  However, bloody diarrhea may be a sign of more severe illness and may require treatment once the pathogen is identified.
<h3>Regarding antimotility drugs:</h3>
    • Antimotility drugs, such as Imodium, should be recommended with caution.  They may help with symptoms and with dehydration, however, they decrease passage of the pathogens and may prolong the illness.  In some cases, they are recommended, in others contraindicated, and in others can be used to decrease frequency of diarrhea but not so much as to prevent all diarrhea.
<h3>Regarding patient education:</h3>
    • Due to potential severity and risk of community transmission, many of these pathogens are reportable diseases in Missouri.  This is done by the laboratory. 
    • Patients should be advised on good hygeine to prevent transmission.
    • Patients should be informed of the species and asked to pass this information along to others who may be symptomatic.
    • Some pathogens are associated with other illnesses and appropriate discussions should be had regarding these
    • Patients should be advised on signs of severe illness and the need to return if signs of severe illness develop

        <h2>Specific pathogens</h2>
        <h3>Viruses</h3>
        <pre>The following viruses are detected in the GI pathogen panel:
            <ul>
                <li>Adenovirus</li>
                <li>Astrovirus</li>
                <li>Sapovirus</li>
                <li>Norovirus</li>
                <li>Rotavirus</li>
            </ul>

            These do not require specific treatment.  
            Patients typically do not need to be contacted because they should have already been given instructions on:
            <ul>
                <li>good hand washing and infection control techniques</li>
                <li>increasing fluid intake</li>
                <li>signs and symptoms requiring re-evaluation</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Special populations</h2>
        <h2>HUS</h2>
        <pre>
            Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) is a potentially life-threatening condition that can also cause renal failure.  It became 
            famous with the outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 associated with Jack-in-the-Box.  

            HUS is associated with:
            <ul>
                <li>E. coli O157:H7</li>
                <li>Shiga toxin E. coli</li>
            </ul>

            Treatment with antibiotics <b>increases</b> the risk of developing HUS in patients with these pathogens.
