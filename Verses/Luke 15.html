    <h2>Verse</h2>
    <h4>Luke 15:23-24</h4>
    <pre>
    'Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let’s have a feast and celebrate. For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’ 
    So they began to celebrate.
    </pre>
    <h2>Context</h2>
    These verses are from the parable of the Prodigal Son.
      
    
    <h2>Meaning</h2>
    <pre>
    This parable tells the story of a son who rejects his father.  His father loves his son.  Although the father loves the son, he gives him the free will to 
    chose his own path, which turns out to be a terrible idea.  Throughout the time the son is gone, the father longingly awaits his son's return.  These verses
    represent the father's joy at his son's return.
    </pre>
    
    <h2>Thoughts</h2>
    <pre>
    In this parable, the father represents God, and the son represents all of us who, as sinners, have rejected God.  He longs for us to turn to him and seek a 
    relationship with him.

    These verses are the origin of the verse in the hymn "Amazing Grace":
    Amazing grace, How sweet the sound
    That saved a wretch like me.
    I once was lost, but now I am found,
    Was blind, but now I see.
