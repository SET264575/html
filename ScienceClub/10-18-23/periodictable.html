    <h2 id="terms">Terms to Know</h2>
    See if you know these terms, then click on the buttons to reveal the definitions.<br><br>

<button class="collapsible">Atom</button>
<div class="content">
<br>
An atom is the smallest piece of an element.
</div><br><br>

    <button class="collapsible">Element</button>
<div class="content">
<br>
An element is made up of only one type of atom.
  
</div><br><br>

    <button class="collapsible">Proton</button>
<div class="content">
<br>
A proton is a positively charged particle in the nucleus of an atom.  The number of protons in the nucleus determines what type of atom it is.
</div><br><br>

    <button class="collapsible">Neutron</button>
<div class="content">
<br>
A neutron is a neutral particle (it has no charge) in the nucleus of an atom.  The neutrons help hold the protons in the nucleus together.
</div><br><br>

    <button class="collapsible">Electron</button>
<div class="content">
<br>
An electron is a negatively charged particle that moves around the nucleus of an atom.  Typically, an atom has the same number of electrons that it has
  protons so the atom has no overall charge.
</div><br><br>

    <button class="collapsible">Nucleus</button>
<div class="content">
<br>
The nucleus is the center of the atom and contains its protons and neutrons.
</div><br><br>

    <button class="collapsible">Ion</button>
<div class="content">
<br>
An ion is an atom that has gained or lost electrons, so it has more or fewer electrons than it does protons.  The number of protons in the nucleus still
  determines what type of ion it is.
</div><br><br>

    <button class="collapsible">Electron shell</button>
<div class="content">
<br>
The electrons move around the nucleus of an atom in what are thought of as "electron shells".  Each shell is limited in how many electrons it can hold.  
  The first shell can only hold 2 electrons, the second shell can hold 8.
</div><br><br>

    <h2>Other Concepts We Didn't Talk About</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>isotopes</li>
      <pre>
        The number of protons in an atom determines what element it is.  If there are more or fewer protons, then it is a different element.  But the number
        of neutrons in the nucleus can be different for different atoms of the same element.  For instance, carbon can have 6, 7 or 8 neutrons in its 
        nucleus.  These different types of carbon are called different isotopes of carbon.  All elements have different isotopes.  The different isotopes 
        of an element all have the same chemical properties because those properties are determined by the number of electrons it has.  The number of
        neutrons in the nucleus affect the weight of the atom and also affect the stability of the nucleus.
      </pre>
      <li>radioactive decay</li>
      <pre>
        Some isotopes are unstable, which means their nuclei will break down, which is called "radioactive decay."  Sometimes when a nucleus decays, it 
        gains or loses a proton and becames a different element.  Radioactive decay is why some isotopes are "radioactive".  The study of radioactive 
        decay forms the basis of nuclear physics and is not usually considered part of chemistry.
      </pre>
      <li>quantum mechanics</li>
      <pre>
        The model of an atom we have been using is called the "Bohr model".  It is very useful, but it is also not correct.  The structure of an atom is 
        described by a scientific theory called "quantum mechanics".  Quantum mechanics explains the movement of electrons around the nucleus (the
        electrons don't really move in nice orbits.)  It also explains the number of electrons in each electron shell.

    <h3>The Atomic Nucleus</h3>
    <img src="Nucleus-of-an-Atom.png" width="60%"><br>
    <pre>
    The nucleus of an atom is made of protons and neutrons.  The number of protons determines what type of atom it is.  This is an illustration of a
    carbon atom which has 6 protons.  The number of electrons is the same as the number of protons to balance out the charge.</pre>
    <h3>Reading the Periodic Table</h3>
    <img src="cell.png"  width="60%"><br>
    <pre>
    Each cell in the periodic table shows what the element's chemical symbol is, what the name of the element is, and how many protons it has in its
    nucleus.  Some periodic tables also contain a lot of other information about the element.</pre>
    <h3>The Periodic Table</h3>
    <img src="Periodic table colored by types.jpg"  width="100%"><br>
    <pre>
    Many periodic tables are colored to show the properties of the elements.  Some elements are metals, some are non-metals, some are gases, etc.</pre>
    <h3>The Lanthanide and Actinide Series</h3>
    <img src="wide periodic table.png"  width="100%"><br>
    <pre>
    Most periodic tables are arranged with the lanthanide and actinide series set off separately below the main table.  This is can seem confusing
    and make it seem like these elements don't fit in the periodic table.  Actually, this is only done for convenience because when they are put in their 
    proper place, the periodic table is very wide.</pre>
    <h3>Valence</h3>
    <img src="Valence 1.gif"  width="100%"><br>
    <pre>
    The number of electrons in the outer shell, which is called its valence, determines the chemical properties of the element.</pre>
