          Welcome to Granny's Science Club website!  I have just started working on this website, so please be patient as more stuff gets added.

          <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
          This website is dedicated to kids who love science and want to know more.
          Here's what each section is intended for:
          <h3>Science Club Supplementary Material</h3>
          This section contains pages related to each of the topics that we have discussed in science club, arranged by date.  A new page will be added each
          week.  These contain a summary of the core concepts we discussed, as well as additional information on related concepts, links to helpful websites, 
          and pictures or videos that help illustrate the concepts.  Occasionally, there will also be links to handouts that were provided at science club.
          
          <h3>Science Around Granny's House</h3>
          This section contains a list of science-related activities that you can do, in ever-widening circles centered around Granny's House.  This is still in
          development, but will contain a list of displays to see at the University, local parks to vist, and things to do or observe around Granny's House.
          <h3>Upcoming Science-related Events</h3>
          If you want to know when the Mizzou Physics Open House or the Great Backyard Bird Count is, this is the place to look.  This section contains a 
          list of science-related activities arranged by month.  There are lots of events at the University, as well as other organizations around Columbia. 
          There is also a list of websites for science-related local organizations.
          <h3>Discussion of Questions That Have Come Up</h3>
          This section contains a list of brief discussions on questions we have spontaneously discussed at science club.  Even though I have a plan each 
          week, the thing I want to talk about most is whatever you are interested in.  Please ask questions!
          <h3>Member Contributions</h3>
          This section is for you.  If you have see something scientifically-interesting and take a picture, if you write up a report, do a science experiment,
          go on a science-related field trip, we can put it here.
          <h3>Topical Index</h3>
          This section contains links to webpages on this site, arranged by subject.
