			<div class="title" id="botanic">Mizzou Botanic Garden Tree Trails</div>
			<div class="location">Mizzou Campus</div>
      <div class="time">Spring, Summer, Fall</div>
			<div class="description">The trails consist of three loops â€” the Jesse Hall Loop, through the Francis Quadrangle; the Lowry Mall Loop, 
				centered on Ellis Library; and the Memorial Union Loop, which meanders among early 20th century limestone buildings. Trees on each 
				loop are identified by plaques at the base of the tree. The link below will lead you to the trail maps and tree descriptions. </div>
			<div class="website"><a href="https://garden.missouri.edu/tree_trails">Website</a></div>
			<div class="recommendation">This is spread across campus.  The self-guided tours (available on the link above) are very helpful.  This is great for
			a walk across campus, whether you are interested in the trees or not.</div>

			<div class="title" id="geology">Geologic Specimens Display</div>
			<div class="location">Department of Geology Building</div>
      <div class="time">Anytime, although this is great for a field trip when the weather is bad</div>
			<div class="description">There is a large collection of geological specimens including rocks, minerals and fossils in the hallway on the first 
				floor and the basement. The basement contains some large fossils that don't fit in a case.</div>
			<div class="recommendation">On one hand, it's just rocks.  But this is a pretty nice display.  It's in the hallway where it's easy to get to without 
			feeling like you don't belong.  Each specimen is labeled and the cases are well-lit.  Each individual rock is a little underwhelming by itself.  Although there are some nice fossils that really are interesting to
			see.  There are also some mineral specimens that are really nice by themselves.  But the size of the display makes this well-worth seeing.  At the end
			of the hallway in the basement (by the stairs) is a display of fluoresent minerals which was cool when it worked, but last time I checked, it didn't.</div>

      <div class="title">Edison Dynamo</div>
      <div class="location">Naka Building</div>
      <div class="time">Engineering Week in the Spring, then other activities are going on</div>
      <div class="description">Given to the University by Thomas Edison in 1883 and used to power the first incandescent lights west of the Mississippi. </div>
      <div class="recommendation">This is an impressive piece of equipment with an impressive history that you can look at from all 4 sides.  Still, not a major
      attraction by itself.</div>

			<div class="title" id="lafferre">Engines</div>
			<div class="location">Lafferre Hall</div>
      <div class="time">Engineering Week in the Spring, then other activities are going on</div>
			<div class="description">Two engines are on display in the basement.  One is a reverse thruster from a NASA Space Shuttle Trainer and the other
			is a turbojet engine with afterburner from a T-38N aircraft used in NASA astronaut training.</div>
			<div class="recommendation">These are tucked away in a corner.  They are easily accessed and they have some labels identifying them.  They have the
			cool feel of being a part of NASA history, being big, and being powerful.  But, they also kind of sit there quietly out of the way.</div>

			<div class="location">Lafferre Hall</div>
      <div class="time">Engineering Week in the Spring, then other activities are going on</div>      
			<div class="description">There are actually two displays, one in a cabinet on the north wall and the other mounted on the south wall.</div>
			<div class="recommendation">Perhaps the least loved displays on campus.  Not lit.  Not labeled.  OK to look at if you happen to be in the building, or
			you just want to check it off your list of everything.</div>

			<div class="description">Unfortunately, this is closed for renovation currently.  However, the Ancient Case Collection is still able to be viewed on the second floor of
      Ellis Library.</div>
			<a href="https://maa.missouri.edu/">Website</a>
			<div class="recommendation">It's hard to say currently because it is closed, but in the past, this was a full-fledged museum with lots to look at.  I
			have hopes that it will be great when it reopens.</div>

		<div class="exhibit">
			<div class="title" id="ag">Enns Entomology Museum</div>
			<div class="location">Agriculture Building, corner of Hitt & Rollins, Room 3-38</div>
      <div class="time">Anytime, but good for bad weather.  Combine this with the game animals in the connected building.</div> 
			<div class="description">There is a large collection of mounted insects as well as a few live insects.  See the link below for a full
			description and pictures.</div>
			<div><a href="https://museum.insecta.missouri.edu/overview.htm">Website</a></div>
			<div class="recommendation">Apparently this collection is fairly important, but I was underwhelmed on my visit.  It has been years ago.
			My impression is that this is a collection for research purposes and not primarily for public viewing.  This does not feel like it is 
			set up for the public, although the public are welcome.  It is a display in a room where other things are going on.  The staff there
			were happy to let us take a look, but it did not have a "museum" feel to it.  It does have a wide variety of interesting insects 
			from around the world to look at.  The live hissing cockroaches were also interesting.</div>

			<div><a href="https://snr.missouri.edu/about/exhibits/">Website</a></div>

			<div class="location">Physics Building</div>
			<div class="description">There is a small display, mostly focused on optical phenomena.</div>
      <div class="time">See this when you come to the Physics Open House, or visit the Laws Observatory.</div> 
			<div class="recommendation">If you go to the observatory on a Wednesday, or the Physics Open House in the spring, this display is worth taking
			a look at.  It is not well-labeled so it helps to have someone who knows what they are looking at with you to help interpret it.</div>

			<div class="description">There is a small display of old chemistry glassware.  There are no labels.</div>
      <div class="time">See this when you come to the Physics Open House.</div> 
			<div class="recommendation">The glassware certainly makes you curious about how it was used.  Unfortunately, there are no labels to help you out.  Not worth a 
      visit alone, but can be combined with the physics building which is right next door.</div>

			<div class="description">A display of snail shells collected over multiple trips from the first half of the 20th century.  There are maps and labels
      that describe what you are looking at.</div>
			<div class="recommendation">Although the subject matter is obscure, the display is beautiful and takes you back to the days of naturalists wandering
