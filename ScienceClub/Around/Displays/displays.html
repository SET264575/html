			<h2>On the University of Missouri Campus</h2>
		<div class="exhibit">
			<div class="title" id="geology">Geologic Specimens Display</div>
			<div class="location">Department of Geology Building</div>
			<div class="description">There is a large collection of geological specimens including rocks, minerals and fossils in the hallway on the first 
				floor and the basement. The basement contains some large fossils that don't fit in a case.</div>
			<div class="recommendation">On one hand, it's just rocks.  But this is a pretty nice display.  It's in the hallway where it's easy to get to without 
			feeling like you don't belong.  Each specimen is labeled and the cases are well-lit.  Each individual rock is a little underwhelming by itself.  Although there are some nice fossils that really are interesting to
			see.  There are also some mineral specimens that are really nice by themselves.  But the size of the display makes this well-worth seeing.  At the end
			of the hallway in the basement (by the stairs) is a display of fluoresent minerals which was cool when it worked, but last time I checked, it didn't.</div>

		<div class="exhibit">
			<div class="title" id="lafferre">Engines</div>
			<div class="location">Lafferre Hall</div>
			<div class="description">Two engines are on display in the basement.  One is a reverse thruster from a NASA Space Shuttle Trainer and the other
			is a turbojet engine with afterburner from a T-38N aircraft used in NASA astronaut training.</div>
			<div class="recommendation">These are tucked away in a corner.  They are easily accessed and they have some labels identifying them.  They have the
			cool feel of being a part of NASA history, being big, and being powerful.  But, they also kind of sit there quietly out of the way.</div>

		</div>
		<div class="exhibit">
			<div class="title">Chemistry Equipment </div>
			<div class="location">Lafferre Hall</div>
			<div class="description">There are actually two displays, one in a cabinet on the north wall and the other mounted on the south wall.</div>
			<div class="recommendation">Perhaps the least loved displays on campus.  Not lit.  Not labeled.  OK to look at if you happen to be in the building, or
			you just want to check it off your list of everything.</div>
		
			<hr>
		</div>
		<div class="exhibit">
			<div class="title" id="botanic">Mizzou Botanic Garden Tree Trails</div>
			<div class="location">Mizzou Campus</div>
			<div class="description">The trails consist of three loops â€” the Jesse Hall Loop, through the Francis Quadrangle; the Lowry Mall Loop, 
				centered on Ellis Library; and the Memorial Union Loop, which meanders among early 20th century limestone buildings. Trees on each 
				loop are identified by plaques at the base of the tree. The link below will lead you to the trail maps and tree descriptions. </div>
			<div class="website"><a href="https://garden.missouri.edu/tree_trails">Website</a></div>
			<div class="recommendation">This is spread across campus.  The self-guided tours (available on the link above) are very helpful.  This is great for
			a walk across campus, whether you are interested in the trees or not.</div>

			<div class="title" id="ag">Enns Entomology Museum</div>
			<div class="location"></div>
			<div class="description">There is a loarge collection of mounted insects as well as a few live insects.  See the link below for a full
			description and pictures.</div>
			<div><a href="https://museum.insecta.missouri.edu/overview.htm">Website</a></div>
			<div class="recommendation">Apparently this collection is fairly important, but I was underwhelmed on my visit.  It has been years ago.
			My impression is that this is a collection for research purposes and not primarily for public viewing.  This does not feel like it is 
			set up for the public, although the public are welcome.  It is a display in a room where other things are going on.  The staff there
			were happy to let us take a look, but it did not have a "museum" feel to it.  It does have a wide variety of interesting insects 
			from around the world to look at.  The live hissing cockroaches were also interesting.</div>

			<div class="title" id="snr">Game Animal Display </div>
			<div class="location">Anheuser-Bush Natural Resources Building</div>
			<div class="description">A large collection of game animals from around the world. </div>
			<div><a href="https://snr.missouri.edu/about/exhibits/">Website</a><br>
			<div class="recommendation">This is an impressive display.  There are detailed descriptions for most of the specimens.  It is well-worth taking a detour to see this if you are anywhere close.</div>

		<div class="exhibit">
			<div class="title" id="physics">Optics Display</div>
			<div class="location">Physics Building</div>
			<div class="description">There is a small display, mostly focused on optical phenomena.</div>
			<div class="recommendation">If you go to the observatory on a Wednesday, or the Physics Open House in the spring, this display is worth taking
			a look at.  It is not well-labeled so it helps to have someone who knows what they are looking at with you to help interpret it.</div>

			<div class="title">Laws Observatory</div>
			<div class="location">Physics Building</div>

		<div class="exhibit">
			<div class="title" id="art">Museum of Art and Archaeoogy</div>
			<div class="description">Unfortunately, this is closed for renovation currently.</div>
			<div class="recommendation">It's hard to say currently because it is closed, but in the past, this was a full-fledged museum with lots to look at.  I
			have hopes that it will be great when it reopens.</div>

		<h2>Elsewhere in Columbia</h2>
		<div class="exhibit">
			<div class="title" id="dbrl">Rocks and Minerals Display</div>
		 	<div class="location">Daniel Boone Regional Library</div>
			<div class="description">There is a display of rocks and minerals on display, provided by the Central Missouri Rock and Lapidary Club.  The contents of this 
		display are rotated frequently.</div>
			<div class="recommendation">This is an interesting display that changes fairly frequently.  Many of the specimens are beautiful.  This is well-worth
			taking a look at when you are at the library.</div>
