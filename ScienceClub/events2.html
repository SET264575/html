        <tr><td>11/17-18/23</td><td>Leonid Meteor Shower</td><td>The Leonids is an average shower, producing up to 15 meteors per hour at its peak. This shower is unique in that it has a cyclonic peak about every 33 years where hundreds of meteors per hour can be seen. That last of these occurred in 2001. The Leonids is produced by dust grains left behind by comet Tempel-Tuttle, which was discovered in 1865. The shower runs annually from November 6-30. It peaks this year on the night of the 17th and morning of the 18th. The crescent moon will set before midnight leaving dark skies for what should be a great early morning show. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Leo, but can appear anywhere in the sky.</td></tr>

        <tr><td>12/13-14/23</td><td>Geminids Meteor Shower</td><td>The Geminids is the king of the meteor showers. It is considered by many to be the best shower in the heavens, producing up to 120 multicolored meteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by debris left behind by an asteroid known as 3200 Phaethon, which was discovered in 1982. The shower runs annually from December 7-17. It peaks this year on the night of the 13th and morning of the 14th. This should be an great year for the Geminids. The nearly new moon means dark skies for what should be an excellent show. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Gemini, but can appear anywhere in the sky.</td></tr>

          The Columbia Young Scientists (CYS) Fair and Expo promotes STEM for people of all ages by connecting youth and families with science and technology research on the University of Missouri campus. The annual event consists of a two-part science fair and expo. The CYS Fair, in partnership with the Mid-Missouri Co-op of Home Educators (CHE), showcases science projects of K-12 home school students. Youth participate in conference judging with campus researchers in three age categories: Kindergarten-2nd grade, 3rd-5th grade, and 6th-8th grade, with additional opportunities for high school students. Judging begins at 9:00 am on the second floor of Memorial Union. Participants should pre-register with Mid-Missouri CHE and will receive instruction prior to judging.

The CYS Expo provides an opportunity for the public to engage with hands on STEM programs.  Science enthusiasts of all ages can explore a variety of booths featuring research and technology activities from scientists in Missouri. The Expo will run from 1:00-4:30pm with a sensory friendly hour from 1:00 â€“ 2:00pm. All ages are welcome to participate in this free event. Advanced registration is not required. Visit the welcome table when you arrive to participate in a scavenger hunt. Parking is available in Hitt Street and University Ave parking garage. <a href="https://theconnector.missouri.edu/science-fair-expo/">More info</a></td></tr>

It is produced by comet Swift-Tuttle, which was discovered in 1862. The Perseids are famous for producing a large number of bright meteors. The shower runs annually from July 17 to August 24. It peaks this year on the night of August 11 and the morning of August 12. The first quarter moon will block out some of the fainter meteors in the early evening. But the Moon will set shortly after midnight leaving dark skies for what could be an excellent early morning show. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Perseus, but can appear anywhere in the sky.</td></tr>
