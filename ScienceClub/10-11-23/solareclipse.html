      <li>During a solar eclipse, the light from the sun is blocked by the moon passing in front of it.</li>
      <li>During a lunar eclipse, the sunlight is blocked from hitting the moon by the earth passing between the sun and moon.</li>
      <li>During a total eclipse, the moon completely blocks the sunlight.</li>

      <li>During an annular eclipse, the moon appears smaller and a ring of sunlight appears when the moon covers the sun.</li>
      <li>The moon orbits the earth every month but does not cause an eclipse every month because the orbit of the moon is tilted.</li>
      <li>You should never look at the sun, even during an eclipse because the light can cause permenant eye damage.</li>

    See if you know these terms, then click on the buttons to reveal the definitions.<br><br>
<button class="collapsible">solar eclipse</button>
<div class="content"  id="solar eclipse">
<br>
A solar eclipse occurs when the moon covers up part of the sun.  So, the moon is between the earth and the sun.
</div><br><br>

<button class="collapsible">lunar eclipse</button>
<div class="content"  id="lunar eclipse">
<br>

A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes through the shadow of the earth.  So, the earth is between the moon and the sun.
</div><br><br>

<button class="collapsible">orbit</button>
<div class="content"  id = "orbit">
<br>

The path that a moon takes around a planet, or the path that a planet takes around the sun.
</div><br><br>

<button class="collapsible">ellipse </button>
<div class="content"  id = "ellipse">
<br>

An oval.  The shape of the orbit of a moon or planet.
</div><br><br>

<button class="collapsible">apogee</button>
<div class="content"  id = "apogee">
<br>

The point in the orbit at which the moon (or a satellite) is farthest from the earth.
</div><br><br>

<button class="collapsible">perigee</button>
<div class="content"  id = "perigee">
<br>

The point in the orbit at which the moon (or a satellite) is nearest to the earth.
</div><br><br>

<button class="collapsible">annular eclipse</button>
<div class="content"  id = "annular eclipse">
<br>

When the moon is near its apogee, it appears smaller in the sky than usual, and smaller than the sun.  If it passes over the sun during that time, it will not completely cover the sun and a ring of the sun's light can be seen around the moon.  
</div><br><br>

<button class="collapsible">partial eclipse</button>
<div class="content"  id = "partial eclipse">
<br>

A partial eclipse occurs when the moon passes in front of the sun but the center of the moon never lines up with the center of the sun.
</div><br><br>

<button class="collapsible">total eclipse</button>
<div class="content"  id = "total eclipse">
<br>

A total eclipse occurs when the moon completely covers the sun.
</div><br><br>

<h3>The Scientific Significance of Eclipses</h3>
    Eclipses are significant for at least 5 reasons:
    <ul>
      <li>Dating historical events</li>
      <pre>
      Because eclipses in any one spot are pretty rare, a historical record of an eclipse can help us figure out the dates and times of other events
    </pre>
      <li>The first evidence that general relativity was correct</li>
      <pre>
      Normally, the stars that appear near the sun cannot be seen because the sun is too bright.  Astronomers are able to see the stars that appear near the sun during an eclipse.  Shortly after Albert
      Eisten published his theory of general relativity, astronomers were able to measure the apparent distance between stars near the sun during an eclipse and show that they appeared to have moved.
      The stars didn't really move.  Instead the path the light from the stars followed was bent as the light traveled passed the sun, just as Einstein had predicted.
      </pre>
      <li>Studying the corona</li>
      <pre>
      The corona is the heated gases coming off the sun.  This normally can't be seen except during an eclipse.</pre>
      <li>The mountains on the moon</li>
      <pre>
      The last little bit of light that can be seen before totality is light that passes between mountains on the moon.  Before telescopes and space probes were able to map the moon, astronomers used eclipses
      as an opportunity to study the mountains on the moon.</pre>
      <li>Public involvement</li>
      <pre>
      Eclipses get people excited about science.</pre>
    </ul>

    <h3>Scale Model of the Earth, Moon and the distance between them</h3>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Earth-moon-to-scale.svg/6400px-Earth-moon-to-scale.svg.png" style="width: 100%"> <br><br>
    <pre>
      It is very difficult to imagine the scale of the solar system.  Even when we just look at the Earth and moon, it is hard to realize how far the moon is 
      from the Earth.  This image shows the diameters of the Earth and moon and the distance between them all to scale.

    <h3>The relationship between the rotation of the earth about its axis and the revolution of the moon around the earth</h3>
    <a href="https://moon.nasa.gov/resources/429/the-moons-orbit-and-rotation/">Video of the earth rotating while the moon revolves around it</a><br>
    <pre>
      This website shows a video that compares the rotation of the Earth and the revolution of the moon around the Earth.  It shows how the moon can rotate
      around its own axis to keep the same side of the moon always facing Earth.
    </pre>
    <h3>A time sequence of pictures of an annular solar eclipse</h3>
    <img src="Annular eclipse sequence.jpg">
    <pre>
      This picture is actually a series of images that have been merged together.  The photographer took multiple pictures during the eclipse.  Because the 
      Earth turns during that time, the sun appears to move across the sky.  The beginning of the eclipse is in the upper left.  As the moon moves across the
      sun, the sun is setting at the same time.  You can see the sun touching the horizon in the bottom right corner.
    </pre>
    <h3>Transit of Venus</h3>
    <img src="Transit of Venus.jpg">
    <pre>
      A transit is like a mini-eclipse.  This is a sequence of pictures taken of the planet Venus crossing in front of the sun.  If Venus were much bigger or
      much closer, it would cover more of the sun and we would consider it an eclipse.  Because so very little of the sun is covered by Venus, we call it a transit,
      but it's basically the same thing.  A transit of Venus is very rare.

      Because the planets Mercury and Venus are the only planets that go between Earth and the sun, they are the only ones that transit the sun.  The other
      planets are outside the orbit of Eart and never cross between the Earth and the sun.
    </pre>
    <h3>Transit of the International Space Station</h3>
    <img src="ISS transit.jpg">
    <pre>
      This is the International Space Station going across the sun.  It is important to remember that the ISS is very small but also very close to us.  
      From the sun's point of view, the ISS would not be noticable at all and it would not seem that the ISS was "crossing the sun".  

      If you look closely, you can see the shape of some of the structures on the ISS.
