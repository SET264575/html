    <h1>Solar Eclipse</h1>
    <h2>Terms</h2>
<button class="collapsible">solar eclipse</button>
<div class="content"  id="solar eclipse">
<br>
A solar eclipse occurs when the moon covers up part of the sun.  So, the moon is between the earth and the sun.
</div><br><br>

<button class="collapsible">lunar eclipse</button>
<div class="content"  id="lunar eclipse">
<br>

A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes through the shadow of the earth.  So, the earth is between the moon and the sun.
</div><br><br>

<button class="collapsible">orbit</button>
<div class="content"  id = "orbit">
<br>

The path that a moon takes around a planet, or the path that a planet takes around the sun.
</div><br><br>

<button class="collapsible">ellipse </button>
<div class="content"  id = "ellipse">
<br>

An oval.  The shape of the orbit of a moon or planet.
</div><br><br>

<button class="collapsible">transit </button>
<div class="content"  id = "transit">
<br>

A transit occurs when an object passes in front of another object.  Often, this refers to a satellite or a planet such as Mercury or Venus passing in front of the sun.  When the sun is completely (or almost completely) covered up, the transit is called an eclipse.
</div><br><br>

<button class="collapsible">apogee</button>
<div class="content"  id = "apogee">
<br>

The point in the orbit at which the moon (or a satellite) is farthest from the earth.
</div><br><br>

<button class="collapsible">perigee</button>
<div class="content"  id = "perigee">
<br>

The point in the orbit at which the moon (or a satellite) is nearest to the earth.
</div><br><br>

<button class="collapsible">annular eclipse</button>
<div class="content"  id = "annular eclipse">
<br>

When the moon is near its apogee, it appears smaller in the sky than usual, and smaller than the sun.  If it passes over the sun during that time, it will not completely cover the sun and a ring of the sun's light can be seen around the moon.  
</div><br><br>

<button class="collapsible">partial eclipse</button>
<div class="content"  id = "partial eclipse">
<br>

A partial eclipse occurs when the moon passes in front of the sun but the center of the moon never lines up with the center of the sun.
</div><br><br>

<button class="collapsible">total eclipse</button>
<div class="content"  id = "total eclipse">
<br>

A total eclipse occurs when the moon completely covers the sun.
