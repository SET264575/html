    <h2>Terms to Know</h2>
    See if you know these terms, then click on the buttons to reveal the definitions.<br><br>
<button class="collapsible">solar eclipse</button>
<div class="content"  id="solar eclipse">
<br>
A solar eclipse occurs when the moon covers up part of the sun.  So, the moon is between the earth and the sun.
</div><br><br>

<button class="collapsible">lunar eclipse</button>
<div class="content"  id="lunar eclipse">
<br>

A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes through the shadow of the earth.  So, the earth is between the moon and the sun.
</div><br><br>

<button class="collapsible">orbit</button>
<div class="content"  id = "orbit">
<br>

The path that a moon takes around a planet, or the path that a planet takes around the sun.
</div><br><br>

<button class="collapsible">ellipse </button>
<div class="content"  id = "ellipse">
<br>

An oval.  The shape of the orbit of a moon or planet.
</div><br><br>

<button class="collapsible">transit </button>
<div class="content"  id = "transit">
<br>

A transit occurs when an object passes in front of another object.  Often, this refers to a satellite or a planet such as Mercury or Venus passing in front of the sun.  When the sun is completely (or almost completely) covered up, the transit is called an eclipse.
</div><br><br>

<button class="collapsible">apogee</button>
<div class="content"  id = "apogee">
<br>

The point in the orbit at which the moon (or a satellite) is farthest from the earth.
</div><br><br>

<button class="collapsible">perigee</button>
<div class="content"  id = "perigee">
<br>

The point in the orbit at which the moon (or a satellite) is nearest to the earth.
</div><br><br>

<button class="collapsible">annular eclipse</button>
<div class="content"  id = "annular eclipse">
<br>

When the moon is near its apogee, it appears smaller in the sky than usual, and smaller than the sun.  If it passes over the sun during that time, it will not completely cover the sun and a ring of the sun's light can be seen around the moon.  
</div><br><br>

<button class="collapsible">partial eclipse</button>
<div class="content"  id = "partial eclipse">
<br>

A partial eclipse occurs when the moon passes in front of the sun but the center of the moon never lines up with the center of the sun.
</div><br><br>

<button class="collapsible">total eclipse</button>
<div class="content"  id = "total eclipse">
<br>

A total eclipse occurs when the moon completely covers the sun.
</div><br><br>

    <h3>Scale Model of the Earth, Moon and the distance between them</h3>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Earth-moon-to-scale.svg/6400px-Earth-moon-to-scale.svg.png" style="width: 100%"> <br><br>
    <pre>
      It is very difficult to imagine the scale of the solar system.  Even when we just look at the Earth and moon, it is hard to realize how far the moon is 
      from the Earth.  This image shows the diameters of the Earth and moon and the distance between them all to scale.

    <h3>The relationship between the rotation of the earth about its axis and the revolution of the moon around the earth</h3>
    <a href="https://moon.nasa.gov/resources/429/the-moons-orbit-and-rotation/">Video of the earth rotating while the moon revolves around it</a><br>
    <pre>
      This website shows a video that compares the rotation of the Earth and the revolution of the moon around the Earth.  It shows how the moon can rotate
      around its own axis to keep the same side of the moon always facing Earth.

    <h3>A time sequence of pictures of an annular solar eclipse</h3>
    <img src="Annular eclipse sequence.jpg">
    <pre>
      This picture is actually a series of images that have been merged together.  The photographer took multiple pictures through the eclipse.  Because the 
      Earth turns during that time, the sun appears to move across the sky.  The beginning of the eclipse is in the upper left.  As the moon moves across the
      sun, the sun is setting at the same time.  You can see the sun touching the horizon in the bottom right corner.
    </pre>
    <h3>Transit of Venus</h3>
    <img src="Transit of Venus.jpg">
    <pre>
      A transit is like a mini-eclipse.  This is a sequence of pictures taken of the planet Venus crossing in front of the sun.  If Venus were much bigger or
      much closer, it would cover more of the sun and we would consider it an eclipse.  Because so very little of the sun is covered by Venus, we call it a transit,
      but it's basically the same thing.  A transit of Venus is very rare.
    </pre>
    <h3>Transit of the International Space Station</h3>
    <img src="Transit of ISS.jpg">
    <pre>
      This is the International Space Station going across the sun.  It is important to remember that the ISS is very small but also very close to us.  
      From the sun's point of view, the ISS would not be noticable at all and it would not seem that the ISS was "crossing the sun".  

      If you look closely, you can see the shape of some of the structures on the ISS.
