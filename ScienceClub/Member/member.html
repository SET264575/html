      <pre>A worked example showing the proper locations of electrons in their electron shells, given the atomic number (number of protons)
      in the nucleus.  This exercise demonstrates the relationship between the element, its atomic number, the number of electrons, and its
      valence (the number of electrons it needs to complete its shell.)</pre>
