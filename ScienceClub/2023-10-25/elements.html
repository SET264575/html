    <h2 id="concepts">Core Concepts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>It is much more important to know some elements than others.
      <li>Many elements are already familiar.</li>
      <li>Each element is made of a single type of atom.</li>
      <li>Some elements do not occur in nature.</li>
      <li>Some elements are more abundant than others.</li>
      <li>The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom determines what kind of element it is.</li>
      <li>The number of protons in the nucleus is called the atomic number.</li>
      <li>An element's chemical symbol is made of 1 or 2 letters.  The first letter is always capitalized and the second letter never is.</li>
      <li>Most chemical symbols are based on their English names, but 11 elements have symbols based on their Latin names.</li>
    </ul>

<li>It is a major component, along with oxygen, of water.</li>
</div><br><br>

<button class="collapsible">Oxygen</button>
<div class="content">
<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Oxygen has 8 protons in its nucleus.    </li>
    <li>It is the most common element in the Earth's crust.</li>
    <li>Fire is caused by the rapid combination of oxygen with other atoms.</li>

  </ul>
</div><br><br>

<button class="collapsible">Carbon</button>
<div class="content">
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Carbon has 6 protons in its nucleus.</li>
  <li>Carbon is so important that the study of chemistry is divided into two branches:  one involving carbon (organic chemistry) and one without carbon (inorganic chemistry).
  <li>Of the known compounds, there are about 10 million organic compounds (which contain carbon), but only about 100,000 inorganic compounds (which don't contain carbon).
  <li>Diamond is made of pure carbon.</li>
</ul>
</div><br><br>

<button class="collapsible">Nitrogen</button>
<div class="content">

    <li>Nitrogen is the most important component of fertilizer.</li>
  </ul>
</div><br><br>

      <button class="collapsible">Sodium</button>
<div class="content">
<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Sodium has 11 protons in its nucleus.</li>
    <li>Its chemical symbol is Na.  This is based on its Latin name "natrium".</li>
    <li>It is one of the two elements in salt, and is therefore an important component of sea water.</li>
    <li>It is also an important component of your blood which helps cells function properly.</li>
  </ul>
</div><br><br>

<button class="collapsible">Potassium</button>
<div class="content">
<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Potassium has 19 protons in its nucleus.</li>
    <li>Its chemical symbol is K, which is based on its Latin name "kalium".</li>
    <li>It is an important component in your body which helps cells function properly.</li>
  </ul>
</div><br><br>

<button class="collapsible">Silicon</button>
<div class="content">
<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Silicon is a major component of a compound called silica, which is what quartz and sand is made of, and therefore, silicon is a major component of the Earth's crust.</li>
    <li>Silicon is used to make microchips.</li></li>
  </ul>
</div><br><br>      

<button class="collapsible">Aluminum</button>
<div class="content">
<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Aluminum is the lightest metal that can be used to make things.  (Lighter metals, like lithium and sodium, are too reactive.</li>
    <li>Although aluminum is very common in the Earth's crust, it was originally very difficult to purify and was more expensive than gold.  Because of its expense,
    the top of the Washington monument is made of pure aluminum.</li>
    <li>Now aluminum is very cheap and used for aluminum cans, and not for jewelry.</li>
  </ul>
</div><br><br>
      
<button class="collapsible">Chlorine</button>
<div class="content">
<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Chlorine has 17 protons in its nucleus.</li>
    <li>It is one of the most reactive elements.</li>
    <li>It is the other component of salt (along with sodium), making it an important component of sea water.</li>
  </ul>
</div><br><br>
      
<button class="collapsible">Calcium</button>
<div class="content">
<br>
  <ul>

  </ul>
</div><br><br>      

<button class="collapsible">Iron</button>
<div class="content">
<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Iron's chemical symbol is Fe, which comes from its Latin name "ferrum".</li>
    <li>Iron makes up a large part of the Earth, although because it is so dense, much of that iron is in the Earth's core.</li>
    <li>Iron easily combines with oxygen to make rust.  When iron is in powder form or thin wires (like steel wool), it will combine with oxygen so well that it burns.</li>
    <li>Iron is used to make steel.</li>
    <li>Iron is part of the molecule in red blood cells that makes them red.</li>
  </ul>
</div><br><br>

<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Copper's chemical symbol is Cu, which is based on its Latin name "cuprum".</li>
    <li>Copper was one of the first metals discovered and used.</li>
    <li>Wires are made of copper because it is a great conductor of electricity.</li>
    <li>It is one of the few colored metals.</li>
  </ul>
</div><br><br>

<button class="collapsible">Gold</button>
<div class="content">
<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Its chemical symbol is Au, which is based on its Latin name "aurum".</li>
    <li>It is a precious metal, and is an expensive element, but certainly not the most expensive by far.</li>
    <li>Along with copper, it is one of the few colored metals.</li>
    <li>It does not easily combine with other elements and so gold jewelry keeps its luster even after thousands of years.</li>
  </ul>
</div><br><br>      

<button class="collapsible">Silver</button>
<div class="content">
<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Silver's chemical symbol is Ag, which is based on its Latin name "argentum".</li>
    <li>Silver is well-known for its antibacterial properties.</li>
    <li>Silver is an excellent conductor of electricity.</li>

    <h3>Elemental Composition of the Human Body</h3>

    <pre>
    Here is an illustration of the major elements of the human body.

    <h3>Important Elements in the Human Body Shown on the Periodic Table</h3>

    <pre>
      This periodic table is displays the most important elements in the human body highlighted in green.  Insignificant elements are in brown.
      This gives you an idea of the main elements to focus on for future studies in biology

          <h3>Elemental Composition of the Earth's Crust</h3>
    <img src="Earth's crust.png" width="60%"><br>
    <pre>
    This is a list of the main elements in the Earth's crust.  The two most common elements, oxygen and silicon, are the elements found in sand and many
    other rocks.

          <h3>The Major Groups of Elements</h3>
    <img src="part-b-periodic.png" width="60%"><br>
    <pre>
      The elements are divided into groups based on their properties.  Metals, for instance, are shiny and malleable (meaning they can be beat into shape with
      a hammer.  Non-metals, on the other hand, are dull and brittle (meaning they shatter when struck with a hammer).
    </pre>
<hr class="hr1">

    <h3>The Alchemist</h3>
    <img src="Joseph_Wright_of_Derby_The_Alchemist.jpg" width="60%"><br>
    <pre>
      This is a famous painting by Joseph Wright of Derby, who is known for his paintings of scientific advances and his use of light.  This painting depicts the
      discovery of phosphorus, which was the first element discovered by a known person at a known time.  Although the painting is fanciful, it is meant to 
      reveal the wonder of the German alchemist, Hennig Brand, who was trying to create gold from urine and, instead, separated out phosphorus.  Although
      Joseph Wright has exaggerated the effect, phosphorus does glow in the dark, which is why it was given a name which means "bringer of light".
    </pre>
<hr class="hr1">

          <h3>Timeline of the Discovery of the Elements</h3>
    <img src="Known elements 1650-present.png" width="60%"><br>
    <pre>
      This graph shows the number of elements that have been discovered over time.  The rate of discovery has been pretty consistent, although it is expected
      that we are near the end of that process, since the elements that have been discovered recently have actually been created.  They are very unstable and short-lived, and it becomes
      increasingly difficult to create new elements.
