      <h1>How is the Gas You Put in a Car Different Than a Gas in the Air?</h1>
      <div class="main">
        <pre>
    The liquid you put in your car is gasoline.  Unfortunately, we shorten this to "gas" which causes confusion, because gasoline is a liquid and not a gas.  In 
    many other countries, gasoline is called "petrol" and people in those countries do not confuse it with a gas.
<br><br>
    We commonly think of three states of matter: solid, liquid and gas.  Water, for instance, is a solid when it gets cold and freezes into ice.  Water is a
    liquid at room temperature.  When water gets warmer and evaporates, it turns into a gas called water vapor.  In a solid, the molecules stick together and
    can't move away from their neighboring molecules.  In a liquid, the molecules still stick together but they can move away from their neighboring molecules
    and mix with other molecules.  In a gas, the molecules move so much that they don't stick together.  These changes occur as you add more heat, causing the 
    molecules to move more and more as they get hotter.
    <br><br>
    Gasoline cannot become a gas.  Gasoline is a mixture of many different types of molecules, including some molecules that are 3 times larger than others.  
    Each of those different types of molecules evaporates at a different rate and becomes a gas on its own. Typically, the smaller molecules will evaporate
    first.  For instance, two types of molecules in gasoline are butane and octane.  Butane is lighter than octane and can evaporate more easily to become butane
    gas.  Octane can also evaporate to become octane gas.  The mixture of all of those gases is not called "gasoline".
