      Water is not on the periodic table of elements because water is not an element.  Each element on the periodic table represents one type of atom, but 
      water is made of two different types of atoms.  In fact, water is made of 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom. You CAN find the elements hydrogen and oxygen on the periodic table. 
    <br>
      Water is called a compound because it is made of more than one type of atom.  There are millions of compounds in the world.  Each of them is made of 
      different types of atoms.  There are only 92 naturally occurring elements (118 all together).  These are the only ones that you find on the periodic table.
      But the periodic table gives us the information we need to understand how all of those compounds are put together.
