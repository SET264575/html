          There are many differences between Earth and Mars that would affect your driving experience.

          </table>

          Let's consider each of these:
          <h2>No Roads & No Gas Stations</h2>
          <pre>
            We'll cover the easy ones first.  Without gas stations, you'd have to bring your own fuel, if you are going to drive a gas-powered car.
            It is very expensive to lift anything from Earth into space.  A gallon of gasoline weighs 6 pounds.  It currently costs about $10,000 to
            lift a pound into low Earth orbit (and many times that to get it to Mars).  So, your gallon of gas would cost over $60,000.  That's why
            NASA rovers use solar energy to power their electric motors.

            Without roads, the drive would be very slow and bumpy.  NASA rovers slowly pick their way around rocks and sandy spots that can trap their 
            wheels.  If you tried to drive fast and hit bumps, you would bounce higher than on Earth due to Mars' low gravity.  But that would slow you
            down even more, because your wheels can only push you when they are touching the ground.

            The reason there are no roads and no gas stations on Mars is because there are no people.  There are no people mostly because there isn't much
            of an atmosphere.  If there were an atmosphere like Earth's, there would be much more reason for people to go there, and there would likely 
            be some people on Mars by now.  The atmosphere on Mars is thin due to its low gravity.
          </pre>
          <h2>Density & Composition of the Atmosphere</h2>
          <pre>
          Mars' gravity is so low that it can't hold on to the gases that make up its atmosphere.  When a gas molecule gets into the Mars' atmosphere, it
          bounces off other molecules until it reaches the top of the atmosphere and then bounces into space.  The lighter the gas molecule, the faster this 
          happens.  Because of this, Mars doesn't have much of an atmosphere.  What atmosphere it does have is mostly carbon dioxide which is a heavier molecule
          than most of the other molecules in Earth's atmosphere.  Oxygen is lighter than carbon dioxide and is lost quicker.  There is almost no oxygen in Mars' 
          atmosphere.  Because gas powered engines use oxygen to burn their fuel, they wouldn't work on Mars even if you did bring your own gas.

          Also, there is no oxygen in Mars' atmosphere because there aren't any of the organisms that make oxygen on Mars.  On Earth, plants and many single-celled
            organisms perform photosynthesis.  Photosynthesis occurs when these organisms use carbon dioxide and sunlight to make sugar that they use for food.  The
            most important by-product of photosynthesis is oxygen.  Most of those photosynthetic organisms live in the ocean.  There is no liquid water on Mars
            because it is too cold.
          </pre>
          <h2>Temperature & Gravity</h2>
          <pre>
            The two fundamental properties of Mars that keep coming up are its temperature and its gravity.  The surface gravity on Mars is directly related to
            its size.  The mass of Mars is only about 1/10 the mass of Earth and therefore its gravity is only about one-third of Earth's.  Less gravity means it 
            can't hold on to its atmosphere.  A thicker atmosphere would help Mars hold on to the heat that it gets from the sun.  Without much atmosphere, 
            Mars' temperature swings from a low of -153 degrees C to 20 degrees Celcius.

            If Mars had an atmosphere like Earth's, it is estimated the average temperature would be about -40 degrees C.  This is much warmer than how cold it can
            get now, but still about as cold as it every gets anywhere on Earth, even in Antarctica.  The other reason that Mars is so cold is because of its distance
            from the sun.  Mars is about 1.5 times as far from the sun as Earth is and therefore only receives less than half of the sunlight that Earth does.
