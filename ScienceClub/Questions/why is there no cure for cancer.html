    <h1>Why Is There No Cure For Cancer?</h1>
        <div class="main">
    <pre>
    Cancer is caused by uncontrolled cell division.  

    Scientists have been working on a cure for cancer for many decades.  There are several reasons why cancer is so hard to cure.
  </pre>
    <ul>
      <li><h2>Cancer is not one disease.</h2><pre>
      Almost every different type of cell in your body is known to cause a different kind of cancer.  Different types of cancer often require different 
      treatments.</pre></li>
      <li><h2>Cancer cells are almost exactly like all of your other cells.</h2>
        <pre>
      Because cancer cells started off as regular cells, they function very much like your regular cells.  It is hard to find a way to kill them 
      without killing your own cells.</pre></li>
      <li><h2>Cancer cells mutate</h2>
        <pre>
      Cancer is caused by mutations in a normal cell's DNA.  In fact, cancer cells often have several different mutations.  After the cells become
      cancer cells, they continue to mutate.  This means that within one person's cancer, not all of the cancer cells are the same.  If a doctor gives
      a cancer patient a treatment to kill their cancer, the treatment may kill all of the cancer cells except the cancer cells that have a mutation that
      keeps the treatment from working.  Then, the only cancer cells left to keep growing are the ones that can't be killed with that treatment.</pre></li>
      <li><h2>Cancer isn't always found early enough to treat.</h2>
        <pre>
      A cancer is almost always easier to treat when it is found early.  But an early cancer is small and less likely to cause symptoms, so it is hard
      to find.  Some cancers are easy to find if doctors look for them.  Therefore, there are screening tests for types of cancer in order to catch a
      cancer early.  For example, a mammogram is used to look for breast cancer and a colonoscopy is used to look for colon cancer in patients who don't
      have symptoms.  However, many cancers are very difficult to find early and there are no good screening tests for them.</pre></li>
