Procedure note:  Closed reduction of right distal radius fracture
The procedure was indicated for significantly angulated distal radius fracture.  
The risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with the patient who provided written consent for the procedure.  
A hematoma block was performed with 10 cc of 1% lidocaine with good results.  The patient was placed in finger traps and 6 lb of force were used to assist with the reduction.  
The reduction was accomplished with gentle, persistent force on the distal fragment.  
The abrasion on the ulnar aspect of the right wrist was more carefully inspected and it was found to have a pinpoint hole through the dermis in the middle of the abrasion.  
This was irrigated thoroughly with saline and scrubbed with saline saturated gauze as well and covered with a Band-Aid.  A ortho glass volar splint was placed.  
Postreduction x-ray showed much improved alignment.  Post reduction exam showed the patient was neurovascularly intact. 
Due to the concern for possible open fracture (although the wound was on near the distal ulna which was not fractured), the patient was given 1 g of IV Ancef in the emergency department and prescribed Keflex
