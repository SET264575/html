            <div style='border: 1px solid blue; margin: 20px; padding: 20px'>
            <h2>General Teaching Points</h2>
<h3>Document Physical Exam Findings</h3>
It is very common to find charts that seem thoroughly documented until they are closely reviewed and then it is found that the part of the physical<br>
exam that is most pertinent to the patient's complaint is not documented.  This usually seems to be pointed out when it is not part of the template<br>
that is used, such as with a focused examination of the:
<ul>
<li>scalp</li>
<li>eye</li>
<li>ear</li>
<li>mouth</li>
<li>neck</li>
<li>chest wall</li>
<li>back</li>
<li>genitals</li>
<li>specific limb</li>
<li>skin</li>
</ul>
However, it may also be happening when the template is not changed and instead a normal finding is reported.<br>

This month three charts were found to have incompletely documented a back exam.<br>
Here are the comments:
<ul>
<li>"NO documentation of examination of the back, extremity strength, reflexes or sensation!"</li>
<li>"No neuro exam of lower extremities documented"</li>
<li>"In documenting "musculoskeletal pain" in chest and back, it might be good to document that you did at least palpate the back."</li>
</ul>
These comments are not meant to shame anyone.  It's still anonymous.  It's just to emphasize the point.  It happens to all of us.  Be aware.<br>
<h3>Documenting Back Pain</h3>
The differential diagnosis of back pain includes:
<ul>
<li>muscle strain</li>
<li>herniated disk/sciatica</li>
<li>epidural abscess</li>
<li>diskitis</li>
<li>osteomyelitis</li>
<li>aortic dissection</li>
<li>metastatic disease</li>
<li>cauda equina syndrome</li>
<li>herpes zoster</li>
<li>and many more...</li>
</ul>
Even though most back pain is benign and requires minimal testing and treatment in the ER, there are a lot of serious conditions that must be considered
and not missed.<br>
Remember to check for "red flags" including:
<ul>
<li>extremes of age</li>
<li>true leg weakness</li>
<li>leg numbness</li>
<li>loss of bowel or bladder control</li>
<li>saddle anesthesia</li>
<li>fever</li>
<li>unexplained weight loss</li>
<li>pain that awakens patients at night</li>
<li>history of cancer</li>
<li>history of IV drug use</li>
<li>history of recent spinal procedures</li>
</ul>
If you routinely ask about these, then it becomes easy to remember to include in your history.<br>
Similarly, a thorough physical exam of the back includes:<br>
<ul>
<li>inspection of the skin</li>
<li>palpation of the spine and paraspinal muscles</li>
<li>straight leg raise</li>
<li>strength and sensation testing of lower extremities</li>
<li>deep tendon reflexes</li>
<li>checking for saddle anesthesia and anal tone (if there is any suspicion for cauda equina)</li>
</ul>
                </div>
            <h3>Plans for next month</h3><ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Return to more commentary in the assignment emails as less verbage did not increase participation.</li>
            <li>Make sure link to Meditech is in assignment emails</li>
            <li>Make sure initial and repeat assignment emails are the same</li>
        
            </ul>
