            <h3>General Teaching Points To Share In Results Email</h3>
            <div style='border: 1px solid blue; margin: 20px; padding: 20px'>
            <h2>General Teaching Points</h2>
<h3>Documenting interpretation of EKGs and imaging</h3>
It was noted by several reviewers that if you document your own interpretation of an EKG<br>
or xray, you should make it clear that it is your interpretation, if it is.<br>
You should use some unambiguous way to note that it is your work, such as "per my interpretation" or<br>
"my interpretation of the xray is".<br><br>
<h3>Documenting teleradiology reads</h3>
You should also copy the interpretation of teleradiology reads and put them in your note, and <br>
indicate the interpretation is from teleradiology.  Otherwise this read will not be easy to find<br>
and the Boone Hospital radiologist's interpretation, which may differ from the interpretation you were<br>
working with at the time, may be the only interpretation that can be found (at least without great difficulty).
<h3>Acknowledging abnormal troponins</h3>
Now that we are using high-sensitivity troponins, we are seeing a lot more that are slightly elevated.<br>
Several reviewers noted the importance of commenting on the suspected cause of the abnormal troponin<br>
rather than not acknowledging it.  Often this is as simple as stating that you suspect the troponin is<br>
elevated due to CKD or CHF.<br>
