            <li>4 of 16 reviewers did not complete their charts</li>
            <li>Average was about 0.51 comment on each chart</li>
            <li>Only 1 provider opted to do extra charts in exchange for having more of theirs reviewed.</li>
            <li>2 providers has only 2 charts reviewed because their other charts were randomly assigned to providers who didn't review their charts</li>

            <h2>General Teaching Points</h2>
<h3>Managing a patient with SIRS:</h3>
As we all know, a patient meets SIRS criteria when 2 of 4 criteria are met.  However, there are many reasons to have SIRS other than sepsis.  Sepsis is SIRS with an infection.<br>
The sepsis protocol requires antibiotics to be initiated within 3 hours after sepsis is identified.  Nevertheless, there are times when a patient with SIRS should be started on antibiotics even if it is unclear whether they have sepsis.<br><ul>
<li>If a patient has SIRS, but does not have signs or symptoms pointing to a specific infection, and initial testing (chest xray, UA) are negative, it is still reasonable to initiate antibiotics if no better explanation for their SIRS can be found.  </li>
<li>If a patient has evidence of a life-threatening condition (hypotension, hypoxia, etc) and SIRS, it may be reasonable to initiate antibiotics even if the SIRS might be attributable to a non-infectious condition until infection can be completely ruled out (such as with a CT chest).  For example, if a patient has hypotension thought to be due to a GI bleed but the chest xray shows CHF and pneumonia cannot be excluded, antibiotics should be initiated until a chest CT can rule out infection, since the patient could decompensate further while awaiting the CT results.</li>
<li>If the patient with SIRS seems very stable and chest xray and urinalysis are negative and it does not seem reasonable to aggressively search for an infection (say, with a CT), then it is reasonable to order a procalcitonin (and possibly a lactate) to help clarify the situation. </li>
<li>It is always important to address SIRS in your MDM and explain what you think is causing it.</li><ul>
<li>"The patient meets SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and tachycardia. CXR shows pneumonia.  The patient meets sepsis criteria at 1 pm.  There is no evidence of severe sepsis at this time."</li>
<li>"The patient meets SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and tachycardia.  However, there is no evidence of infection.  CXR and UA are negative.  Leukocytosis is likely demargination from vomiting and tachycardia is due to dehydration."</li>
<li>"The patient meets SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and tachycardia.  CXR and UA are negative.  There is no evidence of infection at this time so I have not started antibiotics, however, I have ordered a procalcitonin and lactate to help clarify the situation."</li>
<li>"The patient meets SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and tachycardia.  Source of infection is unclear.  The patient has other possible non-infectious causes to explain their SIRS.  Nevertheless, due to the critical nature of their illness, I have started antibiotics while CT is pending."</li>
</ul></ul>


                </div>
            <h3>Plans for next month</h3><ul>
            <li>Elimited the optional charts</li>
            <li>Shorten the assignment email and minimize instructions (which should be well understood by now)</li>
            </ul>

 <b>No </b><br>Comments: <b>The patient was hypotensive, hypoxic, WBC 12, tachycardic.  CXR showed CHF however your note says "could have underlying pneumonia".  The patient clearly has CHF and upper GI bleed which could account for findings.  But, SIRS criteria are met (but not mentioned).  Antibiotics were deferred until after CT, despite a procalcitonin over 4.  There is strong evidence of significant possibility of life-threatening infection with risk for decompensation (given hypotension and hypoxia).  It would have been wise to initiate antibiotics while waiting for CT.  Also, it is unclear what checking the procalcitonin contributed if it was not acted upon when elevated.</b><br><br>7.

</td><td>0</td></tr><h3>1. Were there significant abnormal test results that were not addressed?
</h3><ul><li>You have a full dictated discharge: "As we discussed, the results of the CT scan of head and neck does not show any fractures, dislocations, or intracranial bleeding.  Under the circumstances I think he can safely return home although you may have some achiness in her neck for the next few days.  You may safely take acetaminophen for this and use heating pad or ice packs whichever seems to work best."

But the final diagnosis is Non Q waveMI with the following noted:
"Course/Reevaulation #1: 
Spoken with Dr. Yuen who will be admitting the patient to the hospitalist service on the cardiology floor with telemetry.
Course/Reevaluation #2: 
Patient received aspirin 325 mg given troponin elevation.  Patient received hydralazine 10 mg IV push given elevated blood pressure."

This is one of the charts that didn't pull in the chemistry tests, only the CBC. IT knows about this. </li><li>Good documentation </li><li>You did great. Wonderful documentation </li></ul><h3>2. Were independent interpretations of imaging and/or EKGs clearly documented?
</h3><ul><li>No documentation of independent evaluation of xrays or ekg.</li><li>No documentation of independent evaluation of xray or EKG</li><li>No documentation of independent review of EKG or radiology films. </li><li>EKG not documented in patient with CVA</li><li>Very specific and thorough. Thank you. </li><li>Excellent MDM and discussion of test results.</li><li>No documented CXR or ECG in the note on a patient admitted with elevated troponin.</li><li>You include in the note: "All diagnostic tests were independently reviewed by myself while patient was under my care in the ED."

With the new documentation rules, I wonder if this is enough to justify that you actually looked at everything. One can assume you did... but something could have slipped past you. Perhaps a test result comes back a little later and you didn't see it... then the statement implies you did. This could be legally damaging in certain circumstances.</li><li>ECG interpretation is missing. Again you have the statement "All diagnostic tests were independently reviewed by myself while patient was under my care in the ED." but is that enough?</li><li>No ECG</li></ul><h3>3. Were consultations and communication with other providers documented?
</h3><ul><li>Did not mention hospitalist consult/admit</li><li>Patient was admitted, to Hassan but does not identify conversation with Hassan </li><li>Misspelled Dr Welschmeyer (dictation?)</li></ul><h3>4. Did anything about the disposition raise concerns?
</h3><ul><li>Unusual case of DNR patient en route via EMS who expired.  EMS unsure where to route patient so they called and continued here.  </li></ul><h3>5. Was the standard of care met?
</h3><ul><li>The patient was hypotensive, hypoxic, WBC 12, tachycardic.  CXR showed CHF however your note says "could have underlying pneumonia".  The patient clearly has CHF and upper GI bleed which could account for findings.  But, SIRS criteria are met (but not mentioned).  Antibiotics were deferred until after CT, despite a procalcitonin over 4.  There is strong evidence of significant possibility of life-threatening infection with risk for decompensation (given hypotension and hypoxia).  It would have been wise to initiate antibiotics while waiting for CT.  Also, it is unclear what checking the procalcitonin contributed if it was not acted upon when elevated.</li><li>Patient had history of MSSA bacteremia treated with Cefazolin.  Presented with sepsis over a month later, no obvious source.  You started Cefazolin again. This is not acceptable coverage for sepsis.  Hospitalist broadened coverage to Rocephin and Vanc.  After blood culture results, ID recommended treating with Cefazolin.  Although you were ultimately correct, sepsis from unknown source needs broader coverage (there is an accepted list).  If it was clearly justifiable to start only Cefazolin, you should say so in MDM</li></ul><h3>6. Does the documentation or lack thereof raise any medicolegal concerns?
</h3><ul><li>You did a good job of documenting multiple assessments as the patient deteriorated, however, it is important to include the time of the assessments</li><li>Right below a scary picture of venous stasis ulcers and changes, it reads "no rashes or lesions noted."  Maybe an "elsewhere" indicator to make it clear the reference is to areas other than the picture.</li><li>You don't have a full ROS but there is this: "Review of Systems. Status of ROS: Reports: 10 or more systems reviewed and unremarkable except as noted in History and below". Since we don't need ROS anymore we don't need to document it. Did you purposefully want to include this statement in all your charts? There was no more ROS below this statement. 

Also: "Direct Ophthalmoscopy: normal light reflex". Did you really check this?</li><li>The physical exam includes: "Direct Ophthalmoscopy: normal light reflex". Did you really check this??? Should not mention it if you didn't.</li></ul><h3>7. Were all appropriate sections documented including critical care, procedures, MIPS, HEART score, sepsis, etc?
</h3><ul><li>You should consider using a standard quick text for documenting critical care</li><li>The patient was hypotensive, hypoxic, had altered mental status, upper GI bleed, SIRS.  Should have qualified for critical care.  Also no mention of SIRS criteria</li><li>critical care</li><li>critical care probably</li><li>Sick old person with sepsis and pneumonia. You documented abx, diagnosis of sepsis and lactate was ordered. YOu didn't specify when sepsis was diagnosed but everything was done promply. Also, CXR and ECG interpretation are clear in the MDM. Well done. </li><li>This man came in with delirium and acute on chronic foot osteomyelitis. He was given abx and admitted. There is no sepsis documentation. He had tachycardia on presentation and end organ involvement evidenced by his delirium.</li><li>Good heart score</li></ul><h3>8. Should anything else have been considered?
</h3><ul><li>It would be good to mention that you gave IV Protonix in the ER for the upper GI bleed</li><li>Due to age, mechanism of injury, mental status, and eliquis, I would have gotten a head CT</li><li>No documentation of differential diagnosis.</li></ul><h3>9. Were there any egregious dictation typos?
</h3><ul><li>HPI is one long run on sentence but it makes sense even without punctuation.  </li><li>slightly low sodium at 125 AM assume this was dictated to be "low sodium at 125"</li><li> Patient family give history that he is had generalized weakness for approximately 1 week but over the last 3 days this has got markedly better and today they could not get him to stand up.  I assume you meant he was markedly WORSE.</li></ul><h3>10.  Is this an interesting case that should be shared with others?
