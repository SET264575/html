<h4> Documenting Discussions With Provider </h4>
With the new coding system, the highest level of billing can easily be obtained for admissions.  As you will recall, the highest level of billing is based on documenting the highest levels in at least 2 of 3 categories:  Condition, Data, and Risk.  The decision to admit already gives you the highest level of risk.  Rather than thinking about whether the condition will meet the highest level (sometimes it will, but sometimes it won't), it is easiest to document the requirements for the highest level for the data category.

In order to meet the criteria for the highest level of data, you must 

Although the new coding system may seem confusing, there is one simple trick that will get you the highest level of billing for each admission:
Document that you reviewed the labs
