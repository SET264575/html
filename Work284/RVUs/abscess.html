    Three factors that characterize a “Complex or Multiple” abscess drainage include wounds that: 1) involve multiple abscesses, 2) Are probed to break up loculations or 3) Are packed after drainage. Thus, when appropriate, your charting should look like this: “Procedure — Complicated Abscess Incision and Drainage” => “Making two incisions, multiple abscesses were drained” and/or “Using sterile forceps, the wound was probed to break up loculations” and/or “The wound was packed with iodoform gauze.” That’s what it takes to get properly paid for the service you provide.
