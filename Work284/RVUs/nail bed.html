Answer:  Nail and nail bed procedures may be required for injuries or medical conditions. Injuries may include contusions, nail damage, and nail bed lacerations. A fingertip contusion may result in a subungual hematoma requiring trephination to relieve pressure and pain. Drainage may be achieved by drilling the nail with a needle or with cautery, which is reported with Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code 11740 (evacuation of subungual hematoma, 0.92 relative value units [RVUs], Medicare $33.16).

When damage to the nail is extensive and removal is required, report it with CPT code 11730 (avulsion of nail plate, partial or complete, simple, single, 1.58 RVUs, Medicare $56.94). Report each additional nail with the add-on code 11732 (avulsion of nail plate, partial or complete, simple, additional nail plate, 0.51 RVUs, Medicare $18.38). If a nail bed injury requires repair, report it with 11760 (repair of nail bed, 3.27 RVUs, Medicare $117.84). Note that when an avulsion is performed to facilitate a nail bed repair, it is bundled and not separately reportable.
