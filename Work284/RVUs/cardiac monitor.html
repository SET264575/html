    “The cardiac monitor revealed normal sinus rhythm as interpreted by me. The cardiac monitor was ordered secondary to the patient’s history of chest pain and to monitor the patient for dysrhythmia.” That’s the 14 second phrase that gets you paid in Emergency Medicine. Keep in mind these three steps: 1) When the patient’s presentation warrants, make sure there’s an actual order for the monitor; 2) Chart the rate and rhythm; and 3) Be sure to document the reason. Each of your cardiac monitor interpretations reimburses 0.21 RVUs — that’s $ 7.21 as paid by Medicare 2020.[1,2] It takes just 30 seconds to document two of these interpretations. That’s $14.42, which is more than the reimbursement for your moderate sedation service in the case above.
