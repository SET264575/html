Due to a high probability of clinically significant, life threatening deterioration, the patient required my 
highest level of preparedness to intervene emergently and I personally spent this critical care time 
directly and personally managing the patient. This critical care time included obtaining a history; 
examining the patient; pulse oximetry; ordering and review of studies; arranging urgent treatment with 
development of a management plan; evaluation of patient's response to treatment; frequent 
reassessment; and, discussions with other providers. This critical care time was performed to assess and 
manage the high probability of imminent, life-threatening deterioration that could result in multi-organ 
failure. It was exclusive of separately billable procedures and treating other patients and teaching time.
